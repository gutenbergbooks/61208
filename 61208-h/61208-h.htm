<h1>SYDNEY LISLE</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">A WONDERFUL GUINEA</span></h2>

<p>A rainy November afternoon was drawing to
its close. The sun had set in a haze of fog,
to which it gave a fleeting warmth of colour.
The street lamps were lit, and chinks of light
showed here and there through the shuttered
windows of the tall, dingy houses in a dull
old square not far from Euston Station.</p>

<p>Yes, chinks of light were coming from almost
every house, casting little gleams of brightness
on to the wet pavements and rusty iron bars
guarding the areas; but from one, the last in the
square, considerably more was to be seen.</p>

<p>Uncertain blobs of light, now broad, now
narrow, from the windows of the dining-room,
suggested that the curtains were being drawn
back impatiently every few minutes, that someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
might look out into the uninviting darkness;
and at least three times in one half-hour a
broad blaze streaming out into the night
assured the passers-by that the hall door of
Number 20 had been opened wide, despite the
fog and rain.</p>

<p>If they had paused at such a moment they
might have seen a slender figure, with brown
hair blown away from her bright face, and
eager eyes that searched the familiar square,
regardless of the cold, until a call from within
made her slowly close the door and return into
the brightness that looked doubly bright after
the darkness without.</p>

<p>“Father and Hugh won’t come any the
quicker because you send a draught right
through the house, dear!” a pleasant-looking
girl of two or three-and-twenty remarked, as
Sydney came dancing and singing into the
shabby school-room after her third unsuccessful
journey to the door; “they are hardly ever in
before half-past five, you know.”</p>

<p>“It feels like half-past six, at least!” cried
Sydney. “Oh, dear! oh, dear! I’ve never
known half-past five so <em>awfully</em> long in
coming!”</p>

<p>“Sydney! Sydney!” Mildred said reprovingly,
“don’t you remember what mother was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
saying to you only yesterday? You really must
give up slang and schoolgirl ways, now you are
going to be eighteen next month, and to put
your hair up, and leave off doing proper lessons
and——”</p>

<p>“And become a real, celebrated authoress!”
shouted Tom, who was despatching bread and
butter at the table with a highly satisfactory
appetite. “You’ll have to mind your shaky
grammar now, Syd.”</p>

<p>“Of course I shan’t be a celebrated authoress
quite at once,” said Sydney modestly. “I
believe you are usually rather more grown up
than eighteen first, and have a little more experience.
But it makes one feel ever so much
older when one is really going to be in print.”</p>

<p>“And when you’ve earned a whole guinea—twenty-one
whole shillings!” little Prissie contributed
in an absolutely awestruck voice.</p>

<p>“Read us the letter again, Syd,” Hal demanded,
stretching out his long legs to the
cheerful blaze. “Go ahead; I really don’t
think I took it all in.”</p>

<p>And Sydney, nothing loth, produced that
wonderful letter, which had come in quite an
ordinary way by the four o’clock post that
afternoon, together with an advertisement about
a dairy-farm for mother, and an uninteresting-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
envelope for father, with “Lincoln’s
Inn” upon the back.</p>

<p>The outside of <em>her</em> letter was quite ordinary-looking
too, Sydney had thought, when Fred
and Prissie had almost torn the envelope in
half, in their anxiety each to have the pleasure
of bringing it upstairs to her. Just a narrow
envelope, with something stamped upon the
back, and her name in very scrawly hand-writing—“Miss
Sydney Lisle.”</p>

<p>And then, when she had turned it over
several times, and all the Chichester children
who were in had had a look at it, and tried to
guess what the raised and twisted letters on the
back might mean, Sydney had opened it.</p>

<p>And there was a typed letter, and inside the
letter a cheque for a guinea—actually a guinea,
the largest sum Sydney had ever owned in
the course of her seventeen years! She
never will forget the wonder and delight of
that moment!</p>

<p>“It’s a guinea—twenty-one whole shillings!”
she had told the wildly-excited Madge and
Fred and Prissie. “The Editor of <cite>Our Girls</cite>
has sent it to me. He is going to print my
story in the next week’s issue, and he calls me
‘Madam’!”</p>

<p>This was the astounding news which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
told afresh to every member of the Chichester
family as he or she set foot inside the door,
and which made the hands of the school-room
clock stand still to Sydney, as she waited for
Dr. Chichester and Hugh to come in from the
hospital and hear it.</p>

<p>How surprised father would be, and what a
lovely new fountain pen she would buy for him!
And Hugh—Hugh was always so specially
pleased when anything nice happened to
Sydney! She would get Hugh to take her
out and help her to choose presents for everyone
out of that wonderful guinea, which seemed
as inexhaustible as Fortunatus’s purse.</p>

<p>Father and mother (<em>what</em> a present mother
should have!), and Mildred—Mildred wanted a
new pair of gloves; she should have suède,
the very best. And Hal and Dolly and Tom—Tom
should have the bicycle-lamp he was
longing for, in spite of his remark about her
grammar; and Madge and Ronald and dear
little Freddie and Prissie, oh, what a doll she
would get for Prissie! with real eyelashes and
hair that you could brush! And old nurse
must have a present, too, and Susan the cook.
And Hugh—Hugh should have the very best
present of anybody’s, after mother.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she in these thoughts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she never heard the front door open and the
steps, which she had been waiting for so long,
come down the passage to the school-room.</p>

<p>The watched pot had boiled the minute
that she took her eyes from it: Hugh
Chichester was standing in the doorway looking
at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh!” She was at his side in a
moment, and pouring out the great news in
words that would hardly come fast enough to
please her.</p>

<p>He put his hands upon her shoulders and
looked down—such a long way he had to
look from his six feet two inches—at her
glowing face.</p>

<p>“Why, Syd,” he said, “that’s first-rate, isn’t
it? Well done!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Miss Lisle, the celebrated
authoress!” yelled Tom, rising from his chair
and waving his tea-cup. The toast was received
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Only I wish it were ‘Miss Chichester,’”
said Ronald; “it’s so silly for old Syd to have
a different name!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, she can’t help that,” Tom contributed;
“and her father and mother gave her
to us, so it’s just the same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s ours right enough,” said Hugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
putting his arm round his “little sister,” as
Sydney Lisle would have called herself.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, Dr. Chichester’s
voice was heard calling “Sydney! Sydney!”</p>

<p>“There’s father calling; mother must have
told him!” Sydney cried, and, gathering together
her precious cheque and letter, she
rushed out like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>“The pater is in the drawing-room, Syd,”
Hugh called after her; “he just took up his
letters and went straight in there to mother,”
he added, for the others’ benefit. Sydney was
already out of hearing, and only echoes of her
fresh young voice came floating back to them,
as she ran down the long back passage and
up the stairs through the hall to the drawing-room.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Merrily! merrily shall I live now! Merrily! merrily!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mildred stooped to pick up the mending-basket
which Sydney’s energetic movements had
swept off her knee. “I wonder whether Sydney
ever will grow up!” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s right enough as she is,” said
Hugh, at last beginning on his long-delayed
tea.</p>

<p>Sydney’s merry voice was hushed as she came
into the drawing-room, for mother did not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
boisterous ways, and father might be tired.
But, though her feet moved soberly, her eyes
were dancing as she held out the precious letter
to the doctor, standing by the window.</p>

<p>He turned, and Sydney suddenly forgot the
guinea.</p>

<p>What made him look so old and strange?
And surely mother’s head was bent down low
above her work to hide her tears! Sydney
stopped short, with an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>Father grasped a letter in a hand that shook.
Vaguely she saw that the crumpled envelope
had “Lincoln’s Inn” upon the back. It was
the letter which had come with hers at four
o’clock that afternoon!</p>

<p>The hall clock heralded the striking of six
by a variety of strange wheezing sounds: when
it had slowly tinged away the six strokes, father
spoke.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">HER OWN PEOPLE</span></h2>

<p>Half an hour had gone by—the very longest
half hour in Sydney’s happy life; and there was
silence in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Father had been speaking, but he was silent
now, standing with his face turned towards the
shuttered windows. On the floor knelt Sydney,
her head on mother’s knee. She was not
crying—this calamity seemed too great for
tears—tears such as had been shed over the
untimely fate of Prissie’s bullfinch, or the
sewing up by father of that dreadful cut in
Ronald’s cheek. Her shoulders shook with
suppressed sobs, but no tears came.</p>

<p>“My little girl,” mother was speaking, with
a gentle hand on the untidy brown head on
her knee, “my poor little girl!”</p>

<p>Sydney lifted up her piteous face.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, you will let me stay your little
girl! I can’t go away. Oh, mother, you always
said I was given to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Chichester blew his nose violently, and
came and sat down beside his wife.</p>

<p>“See here, my little Sydney,” he said. “God
knows you can’t cease to be our child to us,
as you have been for these seventeen years. If
it were acting rightly to keep you, do you
suppose your mother and I could consent to
let our little girl go from us? Still, we have
got to do the right thing; and when your poor
young father gave you to us, he had no idea
of your ever coming near the title. But now
this accident to your cousin, Lord St. Quentin,
makes you heiress to it, so your cousin’s man of
business writes to tell me. Lord St. Quentin
wants you, and, my little girl, you <em>must</em> go.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I say I don’t want to be a
marchioness?” poor Sydney asked despairingly;
“isn’t there anybody else to be one instead?”</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester shook his grey head sadly;
Mr. Fenton’s letter had been clear enough
on that point. There was a complete failure
of heirs male: and, in the House of Lisle,
the female had the power, in such a case, to
inherit land and title.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester knew this as a fact, though
he had thought about it very little. There
had been nothing to bring it very prominently
before him in the seventeen years that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
passed since he promised to be a father to
the little motherless daughter of his dying
patient, Lord Francis Lisle.</p>

<p>The doctor had come across many sad things
in the course of his professional experience,
but nothing much sadder than the sight he
had seen one cold December day in the little
bare bedroom of a miserable lodging-house
off Pentonville. He was attending the more
urgent cases of a sick friend, and in this way
came across Lord Francis and his girl wife.
She was lying in the meagre bed, with her
young husband fanning her, and a tiny wailing
baby at her side.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Doctor
Chichester’s wife had come to bring help to her
husband’s poorer patients: she went daily to the
little dingy lodging off Pentonville, while the
young wife lingered, as though loth to leave
the boy-husband who stood watching her with
great, sad eyes. The good doctor and his wife
soon heard their pitiful little story.</p>

<p>Sydney Henderson had but just left school
when she went as governess to the little boy
and girl of Lady Braemuir, niece to the
Marquess of St. Quentin. It was a big, gay
house; but the little governess, playing nursery
games with her charges, saw little of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
company till Lady Braemuir’s youngest cousin,
Lord Francis, came to shoot the Braemuir
grouse before joining his regiment.</p>

<p>The children were full of “Tousin Fwank”
before he came. He had stayed at Braemuir
six months previously. When he came, the
reason of their interest in his arrival became
speedily apparent. Francis Lisle was perfectly
devoted to children, with a genuine
devotion that made mothers beam upon him.</p>

<p>He was known in the nurseries of many
a big house: he made himself at home in the
school-room of his little cousins.</p>

<p>Lady Braemuir laughed at him and his
“childish tastes,” but never said a word upon
the subject to the little governess, hardly more
than a child herself, until a day when, coming
home from a tennis-party tired and cross, she
heard laughter issuing from the school-room,
where Lord Francis, who had declined going to
the party, was found sharing his little cousins’ tea.</p>

<p>Forgetful of everything but irritation, Lady
Braemuir spoke cruelly to the girl, who knew
so little of the duties of a governess. Lord
Francis bore her remarks in silence for a
minute, then the frightened appeal in the
childish eyes overcame his prudence.</p>

<p>He went across to the girl and took her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Excuse me, Gwenyth,” he said sternly;
“there is no need to say any more upon this
subject. I am going to ask Miss Henderson
if she will be my wife.” And he did.</p>

<p>“I wash my hands of the whole business!”
Lady Braemuir said. “Frank must explain
as best he can to Uncle St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>Until that time his fourth and youngest son
had been Lord St. Quentin’s favourite—this
bright, handsome boy, who had made half the
sunshine of his home. He was proud of him,
too, and looked to see him do well in the army,
and prove an honour to the name he bore.
The pride of the old marquess was far greater
than his love.</p>

<p>“Going to marry a clergy-orphan and a
governess!” Frank’s father cried. “Then you
won’t get a penny of mine to help you make
a fool of yourself! Do it, if you choose; but
in that case never darken my doors again!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, then, father,” said Lord Francis;
and he took his hat and went.</p>

<p>The little governess had no near relations,
and the young couple were married almost
immediately. He was twenty-two and she was
eighteen.</p>

<p>He gave up the army and obtained a clerkship
in a house of business in London. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the salary was small, and, strive as they would,
they could not live within their income.</p>

<p>She tried to do a little teaching to add to it;
but her health was delicate and pupils hard to
get. Their small reserve fund melted fast,
though Lord Francis worked long after office
hours at odd jobs for the sake of the few extra
shillings that they brought him.</p>

<p>Hard work and poor living brought their
usual consequence. When Dr. Chichester
broke it very gently to the young husband
that there was no getting better for Sydney,
he was aware that the two would not probably
be parted long.</p>

<p>When the young mother died one grey
December morning, with her head upon her
husband’s shoulder, Mrs. Chichester carried
home the baby to her own fast-filling nursery,
where sturdy seven-year-old Hugh took at
once to “his baby,” as he called her, to distinguish
her from red-faced Ronald in the
cradle, whose advent had meant so many “hushings”
at times when he wished to make a noise.</p>

<p>Under Mrs. Chichester’s tender care the
little wizened baby girl grew fat and merry,
crowing courageously even when Hugh
staggered round the room with her held in
too tight a clasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Her young father used to come round to
the tall dingy house in the dull old square,
when office hours were over, and sit beside
the nursery fire, watching Mrs. Chichester, as
she put the babies to bed, with an oft-repeated
game with the ten bare pink toes of the child
upon her knee.</p>

<p>His little daughter learned to know him, and
to crow and laugh when he came into the
nursery and held out his arms for her. He
began to look forward to the time when she
would learn to call him “Father,” but that was
not to be.</p>

<p>Easter came late, in the spring following
little Sydney’s birth, with hot sun and bitter
winds.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester had never had so many cases
of pneumonia to attend, and one day a scrawl
from Lord Francis’s lodgings told of illness
there. He hurried round to find little Sydney’s
father in high fever. There was from the first
small chance of his recovery, as his strength
was not sufficient to fight illness. He would
have been altogether glad to go, if it had not
been for the thought of his baby girl.</p>

<p>“My people cast me off completely,” he said,
one day, when the end was near, “and they
are not at all likely to receive my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear boy,” said the doctor, “don’t you
worry. We couldn’t part with the little lassie
now; if I would, my wife wouldn’t. Give her
to us, and she shall be our child. She has our
love already, and, God helping us! she shall
have a happy home.”</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you,” Lord Francis had said
hoarsely; and the doctor had said “Don’t!”</p>

<p>It was in his arms that Lord Francis died
three days later.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester had written to the poor boy’s
eldest brother, who had now become the
marquess, telling him that Frank was dying;
but no notice had been taken of the letter.
Lord Francis was laid beside his wife in the
cemetery, and little Sydney grew from babyhood
to childhood and from childhood to girlhood,
with nothing but the difference of surname and
the occasional telling of an old story with the
saddest parts left out, to remind her that she
was not a Chichester by birth.</p>

<p>That unknown mother and father, of whom
this real living, loving mother told her at times
seemed part of a story, not her own life, and
the story always ended with the comfortable
words: “Your father gave our dear little girl
to us, to be our child for always!”</p>

<p>I think perhaps Dr. and Mrs. Chichester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
forgot too very often that Sydney bore another
name from theirs, for though the doctor
certainly read in the papers of the tragic
death while mountain-climbing of Lord Herbert
Lisle, “second son of the late Marquess of St.
Quentin,” he hardly realised Lord Herbert to
be little Sydney’s uncle; nor did her relationship
occur to him when, some four years later,
Lord Eric, “the third son, etc., etc.,” fell a
victim to malarial fever when travelling in Italy.</p>

<p>The papers took considerably more interest
in the matter, and there were discreetly hinted
fears expressed in them lest the old title should
die out for lack of heirs. The present marquess
was in feeble health, and his only child, Lord
Lisle, unmarried. Lord Herbert had been also
unmarried, and Lord Eric a childless widower.
Regret was expressed that Lord Lisle possessed
neither brother nor sister. It was then the
doctor realised that in this House, in default of
heirs male of the direct line, females had the
power to inherit land and title.</p>

<p>He looked at long-legged, short-frocked
Sydney with a sudden anxiety, and for a few
weeks actually glanced down the “Personal
and Social” column of <cite>The Standard</cite> in the
hope of his eye falling on—“A marriage has
been arranged and will shortly take place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
between Viscount Lisle, only son of the
Marquess of St. Quentin, and ...,” some
damsel of high degree. But before long
he forgot the matter in the press of daily life,
and five years had passed peacefully away
without anything happening to remind him of
the House of Lisle or its connection with his
little Sydney.</p>

<p>And now, without warning, the blow had
fallen.</p>

<p>Lord St. Quentin, as Lord Lisle had become
through his father’s death four years ago, had
met with a fearful motor-accident, in which he
had sustained some internal injury, from which
the doctors feared there was no recovery. He
might linger on for months, but the end was
certain, and he was unmarried.</p>

<p>Sydney Lisle had been ignored by her
father’s family for nearly eighteen years; but
their man of business had known where to
find her. It was he who wrote to Dr.
Chichester, requesting that he would resign
his guardianship of Miss Lisle into the hands
of the cousin whose heir she had now become,
the Marquess of St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“We shall have to let her go,” the doctor
had said, as he and Mrs. Chichester read Mr.
Fenton’s letter together. “The child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
never put legally into my charge: I only took
her at that poor boy’s expressed wish. Mr.
Fenton writes very sensibly, and tells me that
Lord St. Quentin’s maternal aunt, Lady
Frederica Verney, is to be at St. Quentin
Castle, and will take care of the child. And
of course she will have advantages we have no
power to give her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton proposed calling upon Dr.
Chichester that evening, and, if quite convenient,
would be glad to see Miss Lisle.
Hence the speed with which the news had
been broken to the girl.</p>

<p>But when the lawyer came, an elderly man
with old-fashioned grey whiskers and keen,
kindly eyes, he had to do without a sight of
the poor little heiress to the title of St. Quentin.
For Sydney had gone to bed with an overpowering
headache, and was fit for nothing
but to lie still in the dark, with eau-de-cologne
on her forehead and mother’s hand, idle for
once, clasped tightly in both hers.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well, for she was spared
not only the lawyer’s visit, but the telling of
the dreadful story to the others—the children’s
questions, and what she would have minded
more, the sight of Hugh’s face, first fierce and
then very white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>But she cried herself to sleep upstairs, while
Mr. Fenton in the drawing-room was inflicting
on the silent doctor a description of the
“splendid position” to which his little Sydney,
the child who had been as his own for nearly
eighteen long years, had been called.</p>

<p>He suddenly broke in upon the lawyer’s
well-turned phrases, leaning forward and speaking
almost roughly to him.</p>

<p>“You tell me of the age of the title—of
the magnificence of the castle—I don’t want
to hear all that! There is only one thing
that I want to know—my little girl, will they
be good to her? Will she be happy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton considered this question for some
minutes before answering it. When he came
to think of it, it was not such a very easy one
to answer.</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle will have, I trust, every reason
to be happy,” he replied at length; “every
advantage will be hers, and a splendid, yes,
undoubtedly, a splendid position.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">UPROOTED</span></h2>

<p>The time was rather after five o’clock on a
dark afternoon a week later.</p>

<p>The train lamps had been lit two hours
ago, and cast a vivid, unshaded light upon a
comfortable first-class railway carriage, with
its well-stuffed seats, well-covered floors, and
tasselled blinds shutting out the winter darkness.</p>

<p>Even particular Mr. Fenton thought the
light good enough to read by, and was leaning
back luxuriously in his corner of the carriage,
immersed in the <cite>Westminster Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>But Sydney, who sat opposite him, could not
read. A pile of magazines considered by Mr.
Fenton to suit her age and sex lay around her,
and she was idly turning up the pages of one
on her knee. But her eyes were fixed dreamily
upon the wall before her, and her thoughts
were leagues away from the swiftly-moving
train, which was carrying her ever nearer and
nearer to the new, strange life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not seem possible that she could be
the same Sydney who, only a week ago, had
been so wildly happy over the letter from the
Editor of <cite>Our Girls</cite>. Why, though six copies
of the paper with her story in it had arrived for
her, “With the compliments of the Editor,”
that morning, she had not even looked at them.
No one had cared: all that happiness and excitement
had been years and years ago!</p>

<p>And yet had ever a week gone so quickly?</p>

<p>The days seemed all too short for everything
she wanted to do in them. In the end she
had done little except follow mother round the
house, from kitchen to larder, from larder to
store-room, and from store-room to linen-cupboard.
The idea of going round to say good-bye
to all her friends had to be given up;
after all, it was mother that she wanted
most.</p>

<p>At night she and Dolly, who shared a room,
used to hold to each other and cry; but in the
daytime Sydney shed few tears. She was
very quiet and wistful-eyed, but trustful of
father’s judgment, only growing a little more
silent as the days went on.</p>

<p>There came a letter from Lady Frederica
Verney, Lord St. Quentin’s aunt, beginning,
“Dear Miss Lisle,” which opening was in itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a shock, and asking Sydney if she would be
ready to come to Castle St. Quentin on Tuesday
next, under the escort of Mr. Fenton. A
maid, whom Lady Frederica had engaged to
wait upon her, would come up to town the day
before, spend the night at an hotel, and meet
Sydney at Waterloo in time for the two o’clock
train down to Blankshire.</p>

<p>Nobody in the Chichester household could
quite see what use the maid could be to
Sydney on the journey; but, by mother’s
orders, she wrote a little note to Lady
Frederica, thanking her for taking so much
trouble, and saying that she would be ready
to go with Mr. Fenton on the day and by
the train suggested.</p>

<p>The first copy of that note had two blots
upon it, and Sydney had to write it again.
Poor little heiress! she quite longed to hear
Mildred say, “How careless!” and “When
<em>will</em> you grow up, Sydney!” But there were
no scoldings now, only a great tenderness
from one and all.</p>

<p>Then there was packing to be done, and
great discussions whether the frocks which
were to have been “let down” next month
when Sydney’s hair went up, should be altered
now. Would Lady Frederica expect to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Miss Lisle in quite grown-up array, or would
skirts to her ankles pass muster?</p>

<p>Sydney took very little interest in the discussion,
only, when pressed, gave her voice in
favour of leaving them alone. “She hated
everything that reminded her of what was
going to happen!” she said.</p>

<p>The children took the prospect cheerfully
until the very end. Nurse had enlightened
them on the grandeur of a title. “Miss Sydney
would ride in her own carriage, pretty dear!
with powdered footmen on the box, and silver
on the harness, and wear satin every day. It
would do her old eyes good to see her!”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be such a silly ass about it,
Syd,” Freddie had said, after one of nurse’s
conversations. “<em>I</em> don’t mind you being a Lady-what-do-you-call-it
myself! You’ll keep lots of
horses and ponies and merry-go-rounds in your
park, and we’ll all come and stay with you and
ride ’em!”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind!” Hugh
told him, rather savagely, and was not greatly
mollified by Freddie’s answer:</p>

<p>“Well, <em>you</em> needn’t! But Syd’s promised to
ask me and Prissie, haven’t you, Syd?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall want you all!” poor Sydney
had cried. “I do hope Lord St. Quentin will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
be kind, and ask you all to come and stay soon,
very soon!”</p>

<p>“No chance of that!” Hugh had muttered
beneath his breath; and then had put his arm
round Sydney, calling himself “a beast to make
her cry, and, of course, they would meet again,
yes, very soon indeed!”</p>

<p>And then had come the last evening of the
old happy, childish life. Hugh had been very
white and silent as it drew on, and Mildred’s
eyes kept filling with tears, so that she could
not see to work, and Dolly was crying quietly
in a corner, and the boys gave up talking about
the hunters Sydney would keep and the motor-cars
she would drive, and relapsed into a
gloomy silence; and Fred and Prissie realised
suddenly what “good-bye” meant, and broke
down and howled.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was rather a good thing, after
all, for everybody was so busy comforting them
and making auguries of future meetings that
there was not very much time to be miserable.</p>

<p>And when one is not yet eighteen, one <em>is</em>
sleepy when ten o’clock comes round, however
wretched one may be feeling. Sydney fully
expected to lie awake all night, but she and
Dolly were both sound asleep when father and
mother looked, shading their candle, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
small room where to-morrow night one would be
all alone.</p>

<p>The morning had been unreal, like a dream.</p>

<p>They all had a kind of Sunday-manner
towards the one who was to leave them.
Mother packed for Sydney; Mildred mended
her gloves so beautifully that one could not see
where the mend was; old nurse came and
brushed out the mane of fine brown hair,
combed back loosely from the small face and
tied at the back of the neck with ribbon; and
Freddie rushed out to the nearest flower-shop
to buy her a bunch of violets to wear on the
journey. He even bore with calmness the hug
with which she received them, though in general
he objected strongly to such demonstrations
from anyone but mother.</p>

<p>Father was to take her to the station, and
she had her last words with mother in her little
bedroom.</p>

<p>“Be a good girl, my darling, and try as well
to be a cheerful one. I know this is a hard
thing for you, but God doesn’t call us to do
anything that is too hard for us. Be brave,
my little Sydney, and make the <em>best</em>, in every
sense, of this new life. God bless you, my
darling!”</p>

<p>“I will try, mother,” said poor Sydney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
choking back her tears, and then father called
that the cab had come, and mother put the
girl’s hat straight, and down they went.</p>

<p>The hat grew rather disarranged again in
the hall over the various embracings; but
Sydney did not feel as though that or anything
else mattered. Somehow she stumbled, blinded
with tears, to the cab, and waved a farewell
to the crowd of dear faces round the well-known
door. Then father said “Right—Waterloo!”
and away they drove.</p>

<p>The hot tears rose again to Sydney’s eyes,
as she recalled the scene, and blurred the page
before her. Not four hours since she had said
good-bye to home, but oh, how long it seemed!</p>

<p>The drive had been short enough; Sydney
thought she would have liked to go on driving
for ever, holding father’s hand, and dreamily
watching blobs of mud fly up against the cab
windows.</p>

<p>But Waterloo was reached very soon, and
Mr. Fenton was outside upon the station steps,
and coming forward to hand her from the cab,
and regret that she had so dull a day for her
journey, and wave forward a fashionably-attired
personage, whom Sydney took for some distinguished
traveller; but who was, it appeared,
her maid, “Ward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Sydney faltered, “How do you do?”
in her shyest tone, and felt supremely young
and miserable. However, if Miss Lisle did not
know what to do with her maid, her maid knew
perfectly well what to do with her. She took
Sydney’s umbrella, and inquired for her dressing-case.
“I haven’t one,” the heiress faltered,
holding tight to father’s hand.</p>

<p>Ward was too well-bred to be at all surprised.
She just said, “Certainly, Miss Lisle,” and
walked behind her to the carriage, where Mr.
Fenton had already ordered rugs and hot-water
tins. She inquired if she could get Miss Lisle
anything, and, on a refusal, remarked that she
was travelling in the back part of the train,
and would come to Miss Lisle at Donisbro’.
Sydney murmured, “Thank you very much,”
and Ward, with a courtly bend of her head,
departed.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton considerately said something rather
inaudible about “papers,” and left father and
daughter for that precious last five minutes, and
then, after all, Sydney could not find anything
to say, but could only stand mutely holding to
the worn cuff of his shabby overcoat and looking
at him with great, hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester had to blow his nose more
than once in the course of that five minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
“There, there, my dear!” he kept on saying,
“things will look brighter presently.... Be
a good girl ... and write to us ... you’ll
like getting our letters, won’t you?... And
I expect this Lady Frederica will spoil you
famously, eh, my dear?... There, there!
don’t cry; it won’t be as bad as you think, my
little girl!”</p>

<p>And then Mr. Fenton gave a nervous little
cough behind him, and said he was afraid the
train was just due to start, and Dr. Chichester
apologised for blocking up the doorway, and
kissed Sydney, and said to Mr. Fenton, in
a rather husky voice, “Be good to my little
girl, sir.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Fenton looked a little frightened,
and said, “Yes, yes, you may rely upon me; I
will make a point of it.” And then a guard
yelled, “Stand clear, sir!” and the train was
moving.</p>

<p>And Sydney had stood up and waved her
handkerchief till the long platform, with the tall,
slightly stooping figure, was quite out of sight—the
last of home!</p>

<p>The letters on the page danced wildly and
then disappeared, as Sydney’s meditations
reached this point. She got her handkerchief
out furtively. It certainly was not being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
brave or sensible to cry at her age. She dried
her tears, and found Mr. Fenton looking at her
in an anxious manner over the top of his
newspaper.</p>

<p>He had looked at her several times while her
thoughts were travelling so far away. He felt
a distinct sense of responsibility with regard
to her, but was handicapped by small knowledge
of girls and their ways.</p>

<p>He had done all that he could think of for
her comfort. He had provided her with a
perfect armful of ladies’ papers, wrapped a
travelling rug about her knees, felt her hot-water
tin to learn if it were really hot, asked
her more than once if he should completely
close the window, and seen to it that she had a
cup of tea at Donisbro’.</p>

<p>But still he felt a vague uneasiness—a fear
that he had not done everything that he might
have done. The girl’s eyes were very wistful—the
dark grey Lisle eyes, which he had
noticed with professional interest. They filled
with tears rather often. Mr. Fenton felt
distinctly uneasy—he hoped the girl was not
going to be hysterical!</p>

<p>She saw him looking at her, and forced a
rather pathetic little smile. Mr. Fenton put
down his paper, folded it, and leaned forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are not cold, I trust?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, not at all.”</p>

<p>“Or tired?”</p>

<p>Sydney considered, and thought perhaps she
was a little tired.</p>

<p>“We shall be at Dacreshaw in less than
twenty minutes,” he informed her, looking at
his watch. She thanked him, and then took a
sudden resolution, “Mr. Fenton, may I ask
you a question?”</p>

<p>“Pray do, my dear Miss Lisle.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton felt a little happier about her
now, and his tone was fatherly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about my cousin,”
she said, looking up at him appealingly; “will
he—will he be kind, do you think?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton rubbed his hands together in
a considering kind of way. “I do not think
that you will see a great deal of Lord St.
Quentin,” he said. “Since his accident he
has lived entirely in two rooms on the ground
floor—no, I don’t think you will see him
very often.”</p>

<p>“And Lady Frederica?” ventured Sydney.
“You told father that Lord St. Quentin is
thirty-four, so I suppose his aunt is very
very old?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton never laughed outright at anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a lady said to him, but he did smile,
a little, half-apologetic smile, at Sydney’s
question.</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Lisle, ladies nowadays are
<em>never</em> old, and it is particularly difficult to
connect that ungallant expression with Lady
Frederica. She is quite a woman of the world,
I assure you, and—but you will find out all
about her for yourself. Ah! here is the train
stopping at Dacreshaw Station. Now, my
dear young lady, we only have a drive of
six miles, and then we shall have reached
our journey’s end!”</p>

<p>A footman in a long drab coat with silver
buttons was opening the carriage door with
a touch of his cockade to Sydney; Ward was
hurrying towards her from the second-class
compartments of the train; the old station-master
was lifting his gold-banded cap as she
went by. Sydney believed, in thinking over
her arrival afterwards, that she clung in a very
undignified way to the arm Mr. Fenton had
offered her, with his old-fashioned gallantry.
She was thankful when they reached the shelter
of the brougham sent to meet her, and Mr.
Fenton had handed her into it, and desired
Ward to follow in a fly. He considerately
made no further attempt to talk to her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
she leaned back luxuriously on the cushions,
watching the reflections of the carriage lamps
in the puddles, but hardly conscious of anything
except fatigue, until the opening of the
lodge gates roused her to the knowledge that
she had nearly reached the place which it
seemed such a mockery to think about as
home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST NIGHT</span></h2>

<p>“Ah, there you are!” cried a gay voice, as
Sydney, blinking in the lamp-light, was led by
Mr. Fenton into the great hall of St. Quentin
Castle.</p>

<p>She felt a butterfly kiss on her forehead, and
then the speaker, a tall, beautifully-dressed lady,
went on talking to Mr. Fenton.</p>

<p>“What abominable weather! St. Quentin
hardly thought you would bring the child, and
has been abominably fidgety all day in consequence.
You must both be frozen! Come
to the fire!”</p>

<p>A splendid fire of logs was burning at the
farther end of the hall, which was divided off
by tapestry from the entrance. She led the
way towards it, talking volubly the whole time;
so it was not till they were standing by the
cheerful blaze, and Lady Frederica had stopped
speaking for a moment to look at Sydney, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Mr. Fenton had the opportunity of getting in a
word. “How is Lord St. Quentin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, much the same, I think,” she answered
carelessly. “He is up to-day—I suppose he
wanted to see Sydney. Dickson seemed to
think he wasn’t quite so well. Dickson is St.
Quentin’s man, my dear,” she added, turning
to Sydney; “a most invaluable creature. I
really don’t know what we should do without
him, for St. Quentin won’t have a trained nurse.
So faddy, but he doesn’t like them. But
Dickson is really quite admirable with him, and
doesn’t mind his temper—<em>so</em> fortunate—and
can read to him, and do all the things which
otherwise perhaps might be expected of me.
Yes, you are like the family—their eyes, hasn’t
she, Mr. Fenton? But you haven’t much of a
colour, child!”</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle is very tired, I fear,” suggested
Mr. Fenton, looking kindly at the girl. “I
think, if I might suggest it, a little rest before
dinner.... I hear her maid arriving now, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, come with me, my dear, and see
your room,” said Lady Frederica graciously,
laying her hand upon Sydney’s shoulder. “Mr.
Fenton, be an angel, and go in and talk to
St. Quentin. He is in the library and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
irritable as can be. I really can’t go near him
till he’s in a better humour. Come, Sydney.”</p>

<p>They went together up the wide, shallow
staircase, guarded at its foot by two highly
realistic-looking stuffed bears—shot by the
present marquess in the Rockies some years
ago, Lady Frederica explained, in answer to
the girl’s shy admiration.</p>

<p>She had not time to look at the magnificent
collection of sheathed rapiers which adorned
the walls of the long corridor through which
they next passed. Lady Frederica hurried her
along, remarking that she would have plenty of
time for studying all “those tiresome old historic
treasures” by-and-by.</p>

<p>“The castle is simply full of them,” she said.
“All the Lisles have been collectors; it is one
of their many irritating ways. I hope you
haven’t any hobby, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Hobby” was a new word in Sydney’s
vocabulary, and she hardly knew how to answer
the question. But a reply was the one thing
Lady Frederica never wanted, and she went on
talking in her clear, high-bred, rather monotonous
voice until they reached the first of Sydney’s
rooms.</p>

<p>“They all open from one another,” she
said, as the girl looked round with dazzled eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
“You like them? That’s right. St. Quentin
told me to get everything you would require.
Your bedroom is the innermost, you see. Then
comes your morning-room, where you can do
what you like without risk of being interfered
with. And this last is your school-room—yours,
too; till you share it with a governess.
How old are you, by the way?”</p>

<p>“I shall be eighteen on the thirty-first of
December,” Sydney answered.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I shall let you off regular
lessons,” Lady Frederica said; “but you must
have masters for accomplishments. I shall
tell St. Quentin so. I don’t suppose you learnt
much with that doctor—what was his name?—Chichester?
Gracious, child, how white you
are! I hope you are not going to be delicate!
One invalid in the castle is quite enough—especially
one with a temper like St. Quentin’s.
I’ll send your maid to you, and you had better
rest a little before dressing for dinner. We
dine at eight. Au revoir, my dear!”</p>

<p>And Lady Frederica flitted away, leaving
Sydney in her new domain.</p>

<p>She took off her coat, hat, and gloves, and
put them tidily away, then knelt down by the
bright fire blazing in the dainty tiled grate of
her bedroom and looked round it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It was certainly a contrast from the little
bare room she and Dolly shared at home,
where there was no space for anything that
was not strictly needful. This room was more
like a drawing-room than a bedroom, Sydney
thought.</p>

<p>The prevailing colour was a delicate rose
pink; the carpet, soft as velvet to her feet,
was rose and green; the window-curtains fell
to the floor in long, soft folds of rose-silk fringed
with gold.</p>

<p>An easy-chair drawn invitingly to the fire
was covered in brocade of the same, and the
satin quilt upon the lofty bed was rose and
gold.</p>

<p>“It is <em>much</em> too beautiful for me!” thought
Sydney, and went through the curtained door
into what Lady Frederica had called her
morning-room.</p>

<p>A soft moss green was the prevailing colour
here; Sydney’s weariness was forgotten as she
darted from the dainty writing-table with its
silver-topped ink-stands and chased blotting-case,
to the small but perfect piano standing
across one corner of the room.</p>

<p>She felt as yet too much a visitor to open
it and try its tone, as she would have liked
to do, and the next moment had forgotten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
desire, and had flung herself upon her knees
beside the book-case, green and gold to match
her room, and full of story-books!</p>

<p>She took out two or three at random, and
“dipped” luxuriously, half-kneeling, half-sitting,
crumpled anyhow upon the floor. A whole
book-case full of new books to be read! She
<em>was</em> a lucky girl. A picture flashed back vividly
into her mind of the “children’s book-case”
at home, where every book had been read and
re-read times out of number, and was like an
old friend. Oh, if she could only transport
all these lovely things into the shabby school-room
at home! How Mildred would love the
rose-and-gold bedroom—dear Millie, who cared
for pretty things so much, and hardly ever had
any!</p>

<p>And oh, what raptures Dolly would have
gone into over that exquisite little piano!—Dolly,
who had been known to cry, yes, really
cry, when trying ineffectually to wile some
music out of the ancient yellow keys of theirs
at home. And how Madge and Fred and
Prissie would have loved some—just half-a-dozen—just
<em>one</em>, of this profusion of new books
before her!</p>

<p>It is poor fun to enjoy things all alone! A
great tear splotched down upon the blue-and-gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cover of the book that Sydney was holding,
and left a mark upon it. She dried it hastily,
and got up from the floor, just as Ward came
into the room.</p>

<p>“Would you wish to dress, ma’am? It is
half-past seven.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please,” the girl answered, wondering
if she ever would have courage to address this
dignified person familiarly as “Ward.”</p>

<p>It did not seem very possible at present.</p>

<p>Sydney did not own a real evening dress,
but Ward managed the plain white nuns-veiling
frock which she and Dolly had had
just alike for the Christmas parties last year
so as to make it look very nice.</p>

<p>It proved to be a little short. “I think
perhaps I had better let a tuck down before
to-morrow night,” Sydney suggested meekly,
noticing how much slender black ankle showed
beneath it.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause before Ward
answered her with studied calm, “I do not
think that will be necessary, ma’am.”</p>

<p>She was dressed in good time, and stood
looking rather forlornly at her maid, who was
on her knees, unpacking, with a quite expressionless
face, the clothes mother had put
in so carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lady Frederica sits in the gold drawing-room
this week, ma’am,” Ward said, guessing
the reason of the girl’s perplexity; “the second
door to the right of the inner hall. Shall I
come with you to the stairs, ma’am?” she
added, rising.</p>

<p>Sydney thanked her warmly. “I am a little
afraid of losing myself here,” she said shyly,
at which Ward smiled condescendingly, and
said that “Miss Lisle would soon be quite
accustomed to the Castle.”</p>

<p>She took the girl to the head of the wide
stairs, reiterated her instructions, and let
Sydney to go down the stairs and through
the sombre splendour of the hall, alone.</p>

<p>Although lit by many antique hanging lamps,
its immensity made it rather dark, and the
suits of armour standing in the corners had
a very ghost-like appearance. Sydney crossed
the black polished floor as fast as its slipperiness
would allow, and was about to open the
second door on the right, according to her
maid’s instructions, when a voice spoke, not
loud, but imperatively, “Are you Sydney?”</p>

<p>She turned, and saw that a long couch on
wheels was drawn up near the great log fire,
and that the man upon it had moved his head
and was looking at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>She crossed the hall again and came to him,
putting her hand diffidently into his. “So you
are Sydney?” Lord St. Quentin said.</p>

<p>What Sydney saw, as she returned his steady
gaze, was a tall man, lying very nearly flat,
his head only just raised by a small pillow.
His hair was dark brown like her own and his
eyes grey; but there the likeness ceased.
The face was thin, the mouth cynical, and the
sharp line drawn down the middle of his
forehead made it strangely different from the
girl’s smooth one.</p>

<p>What he saw was a slight girl dressed in
white, looking taller than she really was by
reason of her slenderness, with a cloud of soft
brown hair framing her face and hanging in
a long tail down her back; and earnest, pitying,
dark grey eyes fixed upon him. They looked
at each other in silence for a full minute; then
St. Quentin released her hand and pointed to
a low chair by his side.</p>

<p>“You had a cold journey?”</p>

<p>“Not very cold,” said Sydney shyly.</p>

<p>There was a pause. St. Quentin was frowning.
Sydney felt that she ought to originate
a subject in her turn.</p>

<p>“I hope you are better to-day, Lord St.
Quentin?” she got out with an effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord St. Quentin stopped frowning, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’m all right,” he said shortly;
then added with half a smile, “Drop the
‘Lord,’ please—we are cousins!”</p>

<p>“Well, Sydney, so you and St. Quentin have
made acquaintance already?” Lady Frederica
exclaimed, coming down the stairs as the gong
began to sound with a roar like distant
thunder. “How clever of you to find each
other out! How are you now, my dear boy?
Dickson told me you were ‘rather low’: how
I hate that expression in the mouth of servants!
It always means ill-tempered. Now, my maid
can never say I’m ‘low,’ at all events. I
make a point of never giving way to low
spirits. Ah, Mr. Fenton,” as the old lawyer
came into the circle of fire-light, “here you
are!—punctual as usual! I have just been
telling St. Quentin he shouldn’t give way
to low spirits; a mistake, isn’t it? I suppose
you will dine in the library, St. Quentin?
Shall we see you again to-night?”</p>

<p>“You might come to me in the library
for five minutes after dinner, if you will, Aunt
Rica,” he answered rather moodily. “I won’t
keep you. Good-night, Sydney.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Cousin St. Quentin,” the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
said. Her cousin’s thin hand took hers for
a minute, and she followed Lady Frederica
in to dinner.</p>

<p>Sydney thought the meal unending. The
long table, the enormous room, the powdered
footmen all combined to make her feel strange
and very, <em>very</em> homesick. But the dessert had
been partaken of at last, and Lady Frederica
looked at the girl. “Shall we come, my dear?
You’ll join us presently in the gold drawing-room,
Mr. Fenton?”</p>

<p>The old lawyer held the door open, and the
two passed out to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Pull a chair up to the fire, child,” said Lady
Frederica with a shiver. “I suppose I must
go to St. Quentin: he probably wants to give
me some further directions about you. I shan’t
be long: my dear nephew is not by any means
good company, I can assure you!”</p>

<p>And her grey and silver draperies swept out
of the gold drawing-room.</p>

<p>Sydney drew a chair to the fire as she had
been told, and sat staring into it with dreamy
eyes. Nine o’clock. At this time they all
would be in the drawing-room at home, except
the little ones in bed. Father would very likely
be reading aloud to mother something that had
interested him; Madge making doll’s clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in her special corner of the room, with a good
many whispered appeals to Mildred over some
tiresome garment that would not come right,
and Hugh and Hal would be playing one of
their interminable games of chess—supposing
Hugh had not been called out to see some sick
person. Just <em>one</em> chair would be empty, that
little dumpy cane one in which she usually sat,
which creaked so much as to make a never-ceasing
joke about “Sydney’s prodigious
weight”! Sydney’s head sank low, and the
fire grew blurred when she thought about that
little chair. Was it only last night she had
been in the dear drawing-room at home with
all of them?</p>

<p>When, ten minutes later, the coffee and Mr.
Fenton came noiselessly together into the gold
drawing-room, the old lawyer found the little
heiress leaning back in the great arm-chair
by the fire asleep.</p>

<p>He stood looking at her for a moment, and
then rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Send Miss Lisle’s maid to her room at
once,” he ordered, and then gently woke her.</p>

<p>“Do not be alarmed, my dear young lady;
it is only I,” he said. “I was compelled to
rouse you, because I am certain you ought to
go to bed. I have sent your maid to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
room, and I strongly advise you to go there immediately
without waiting for Lady Frederica’s
return. I will explain everything to her.”</p>

<p>Sydney was only too glad to go. “Thank
you very much,” she said, holding out her hand
to Mr. Fenton. He watched her go slowly
up the wide staircase before returning to the
drawing-room, where he was joined in a minute
by Lady Frederica.</p>

<p>“Went to sleep while you were talking to
her, did she?” she laughed. “Dear me, Mr.
Fenton, how abominably prosy you must have
been! Oh, it was <em>before</em> you came in from the
dining-room, was it? Fancy the child finding
us so wearying, even in our absence! I must
tell St. Quentin that: it will make him shriek!”</p>

<p>But when she had tripped back into the
library where her nephew, his brows drawn
very close together, was endeavouring to read,
Lord St. Quentin did not seem to find the
information she had come to bring him so
particularly funny.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl!” was all he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST MORNING</span></h2>

<p>Bright sunshine greeted Sydney when she
awoke on the first morning in her new home.</p>

<p>It fell softly through the shading blinds upon
the dainty fittings of her luxurious room, and
on Ward, as she stood beside her with a tray,
containing a fairy-like tea-set for one.</p>

<p>“Oh, what <em>is</em> the time?” cried poor Sydney
in dismay. Surely she had overslept herself,
and Ward was bringing her a rather unsubstantial
breakfast in bed!</p>

<p>“Eight o’clock, ma’am,” the maid answered
softly, placing the tray on a little table by her
bedside. “Would you wish me to draw the
blinds up, or shall I leave them down till you
get up?”</p>

<p>“What time is breakfast?” Sydney asked.</p>

<p>“Lady Frederica breakfasts in her bedroom,
Miss Lisle,” said Ward; “and so of course
does his lordship since his accident. Mr.
Fenton commonly likes his about ten o’clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
when staying here, I have heard. He breakfasts
downstairs. Lady Frederica thought you
would wish to take yours in bed.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather get up,” said poor
Sydney. “I am not at all tired now, and I
get up at seven at home.”</p>

<p>Ward never seemed to be surprised at
anything.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am; what time would you wish to
get up?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“When I have drunk my tea, please,” the
girl said; “that is—unless you think Lady
Frederica would mind?”</p>

<p>A very faint smile did part Ward’s lips for
a moment, but only for a moment. “I am
sure her ladyship would wish you to do exactly
as you please, ma’am,” she said, and withdrew
to desire a housemaid to bring up Miss Lisle’s
hot water.</p>

<p>“Exactly as I please; this <em>is</em> an odd place!”
thought Sydney, as she sipped her tea out of
a Dresden china cup and ate the wafer bread
and butter provided.</p>

<p>She took heart of grace and rejected Ward’s
services over her morning toilet: the sunshine
had given her fresh courage, and she felt quite
a different being from the tired-out, homesick
Sydney of last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>She was dressed by a quarter to nine, and
stood looking from her window at the green
park, with its great bare spreading trees below
her. Only a quarter to nine! What should
she do with herself till breakfast time? At
this hour at home, breakfast would be a thing
of the past, and father and Hugh have gone
off to the hospital. And mother would have
done a hundred and one things before settling
down to teaching the girls; and the boys
would have been off—the younger ones to
school, and Hal to King’s College. And
Sydney herself would have been practising,
or hearing Prissie practise, on that old shabby
school-room piano. How odd it felt!</p>

<p>Five minutes passed by very slowly; Sydney
went and knelt down by the fire that the
housemaid had lit when she brought the water.
One hour and ten minutes before breakfast-time—perhaps
more, if Mr. Fenton were late!</p>

<p>“I know!” she cried, rising quickly to her
feet, and hurrying into thick boots, coat and
scarlet tam-o’-shanter. She would go out and
explore the park till ten o’clock.</p>

<p>She ran downstairs to the great hall, meeting
nobody until she came out on the splendid
flight of marble steps, which a man was
cleaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>He got up from his knees and stared, when
he saw a young lady march out of the double
doors, with the evident intention of going for
a walk.</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” Sydney cried brightly,
as she ran down the steps, leaving the man
still staring after the slight figure and red cap.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m blowed!” he said at last, returning
to his work.</p>

<p>The park was rather wet, but Sydney’s
boots were thick, and she scorned the plain,
uninteresting road along which she had driven
last night. She cut across the grass at right
angles, running at intervals to keep herself
warm, and startling the deer not a little.
Never having seen these animals outside the
Zoological Gardens, she was much excited by
their discovery, and made many unsuccessful
attempts to coax them to her.</p>

<p>By-and-by she came to the boundary of the
park. There was no gate, but a convenient
gap in the hedge; through which she climbed
without difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“Sydney’s dash forward was not a bit too soon.”</p>
<p class="caption-r">(<a href="#Page_59">Page 59</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>As she dropped from the gap into the road
beneath, she became aware that somebody a
good deal smaller than herself was going to do
the same thing on the other side of the road.
Through a thin hedge topping a high grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bank appeared, first, two small kicking legs,
and then something fat and roundabout in blue,
surmounted by a crop of red curls. Sydney’s
dash forward was not a bit too soon, for the
creature rolled down the bank at a prodigious
pace, alighting fortunately in her arms. It
wriggled from her in a moment, and regained
its feet. Then Sydney saw that it was a round-faced,
red-haired little boy, dressed in a navy
blue serge smock, just now extremely muddy.</p>

<p>He stopped to pull on the wet strapped shoe
which the mud in the ditch had nearly sucked
from his foot, pulled down his belt about his
bunchy little petticoats, and observed affably,
“Hullo, big girl!”</p>

<p>“You have scratched your face, dear, getting
through that hedge,” Sydney said, looking him
over; “doesn’t it hurt you?”</p>

<p>The small boy beamed all over in a condescending
smile.</p>

<p>“Scwatches don’t hurt <em>boys</em>!” he assured her,
with a strong emphasis upon the last word.</p>

<p>“What is your name, dear?” she asked him.</p>

<p>“I’m Pauly Seaton,” he explained confidentially,
“and I’m going to be five quite
soon. Big girl, shall we go home now, ’cause
I’m daddy’s boy, and he doesn’t like me to be
lostened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>He put his hand into Sydney’s quite confidingly.
“But where do you live, Pauly
dear?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Vicarwidge, of course,” he said; “come on,
big girl!”</p>

<p>They went a few steps together; then Pauly
stopped, with an expression of dismay on his
round baby face. “Oh, bover, big girl, my
shoe is stuck like my teef in toffee!”</p>

<p>Sydney knelt down to investigate, and extract
the little shoe which had stuck so tightly
in the mud. But, alas! in the tug Pauly had
given it the frail bottom had come off.</p>

<p>Sydney picked up the sodden shoe and put
it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Get on my back, Pauly, and I’ll carry you.”</p>

<p>Pauly liked this idea, and shouted gleefully,
as, with much effort upon Sydney’s part, his
sturdy little form was hoisted to her shoulders,
and his muddy toes, one shoeless, put into her
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pauly, you <em>are</em> wet!” she cried. “I
expect your mother will put you into dry socks
the minute you get home.”</p>

<p>“Me and daddy haven’t got no muvvers,”
Pauly said. “There’s ‘In Memorwy of
Wose’ in the churchyard. God wented and
wanted muvver, that was why. Gee-up, horse!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Sydney! the “geeing-up” was not so
easy. Pauly was no light weight. Her face
grew scarlet and her breath a little gasping.
She sincerely hoped the vicarage was not far
away, and was not sorry when, as they turned
into its drive, a tall figure came hurrying to
meet them.</p>

<p>“Daddy!” shouted Pauly gleefully, and, as
Mr. Seaton hastened to remove the burden
from the tired horse, he explained: “Got
frew the hedge of the kitchen garden, daddy,
and fell down a gweat big way, and there was
this gweat big girl there, and she caught me
in her gweat big hands!”</p>

<p>The Vicar reached round his small son, to
give his hand to Sydney, with a smile that she
liked.</p>

<p>“You seem to have been very good to my
little scamp,” he said, “and I’m afraid you’re
quite done up with carrying the great lump—that’s
what you are, Pauly! Come in and have
some milk or something; and then, if you’ll tell
me where you live, I’ll drive you home.”</p>

<p>“I am Sydney Lisle,” she answered shyly,
“and I have just come to live at St. Quentin
Castle.”</p>

<p>They had reached the pretty gabled Vicarage
by now. Mr. Seaton looked at her with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
kindly, amused scrutiny as he held the door
open for her. “So you are Miss Lisle?” was
all he said.</p>

<p>A maid was sweeping the hall. “Would
you fetch a glass of milk and some cake,
Elizabeth?” the Vicar said. “Now, Miss Lisle,
shall I leave you to rest and refresh yourself in
the dining-room, or will you like better to come
to Pauly’s nursery, while I put him into dry
clothes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the nursery, please!” said Sydney.</p>

<p>Pauly led the way up the steep uncarpeted
nursery stairs, guarded at the top by a wicket
gate, and would have liked to do the honours
of “my wocking horse” and “my own bed,”
but his father quietly checked him.</p>

<p>“Go into the night nursery and take your
shoes and socks off, Pauly. Now, Miss Lisle,
sit down in that chair, please. Here comes
the milk—that’s right.”</p>

<p>He put the milk and cake on a small table
beside her, and retired into the night nursery
to find dry clothes for his little son. Sydney
drank the milk and ate a noble slice of cake,
finding herself really very hungry now that she
had time to think about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton redressed his little son with a
speed which showed he was not playing nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for the first time, and the two came back into
the day nursery, the Vicar carrying sundry little
muddy garments to hang on the high nursery
guard. He talked very pleasantly to Sydney
all the time, asking where she had lived before,
and whether she knew Blankshire at all.</p>

<p>“No, we usually go somewhere near London
for our holidays,” she explained. “You see,
there are a good many of us.”</p>

<p>“You’ll miss them,” said the Vicar, noticing
the little tremble in her voice, as she spoke of
home. “I am afraid it will be rather dull
for you here at first. But you will make
your own interests before long. Life has a
knack of growing very interesting, you will
find, wherever we are called upon to live it.”</p>

<p>Sydney had heard things like this in sermons
before, but somehow the fact that this was said
to her in the homely surroundings of a nursery
made it strike her more. Certainly Mr. Seaton
himself did not look like a man who found
life uninteresting. She smiled and looked up
frankly.</p>

<p>“They are all so kind,” she said, “and
say, ‘Do what you like.’ But it doesn’t seem
that there is anything to do.”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” said the Vicar briskly, “and
you’ll find it if you look for it. I wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
whether Lord St. Quentin would allow you
to take a little class in the Sunday School,
for one thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should just love to!” Sydney cried.
“Mother always said I might when I was
eighteen, and my birthday is next month.
Only I don’t know a great deal.”</p>

<p>She noticed that the Vicar did not comment
upon her acceptance.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for your willingness
to help,” he said. “I will write to your
cousin.”</p>

<p>“I am certain he won’t mind,” the girl said
happily. “He is very kind, you know, and
told Lady Frederica to put the loveliest things
into my rooms. But, please, I think I ought
to be going now, for Mr. Fenton has his
breakfast at ten.”</p>

<p>The Vicar laughed. “I am afraid Mr.
Fenton will have breakfasted alone this morning,
owing to my little scamp here. Do you
know what the time is?”</p>

<p>“No.” Sydney was rather frightened.</p>

<p>“Ten-thirty.”</p>

<p>She sprang up with a cry of dismay. “Oh,
how dreadful! I must run!”</p>

<p>“You won’t do any such thing!” said the
Vicar firmly. “I am going to drive you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the Castle in my pony-cart, and explain your
disappearance.”</p>

<p>“I come, too!” Pauly cried, scrambling up
from the centre of the hearth-rug in a great
hurry.</p>

<p>“No,” said the Vicar gravely. “I told you
not to go into the kitchen garden alone, Pauly.
You must be obedient before daddy takes
you out with him.”</p>

<p>Pauly did not cry, as Sydney half expected.
He twisted his fingers in and out of his belt
in silence for a minute; then observed defiantly,
“Bad old Satan come along and said, ‘Pauly,
go into the kitchen garden.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Vicar gravely, “but what
ought Pauly to have done?”</p>

<p>Pauly slowly stumped across the room, and
stood looking wistfully from the barred window.</p>

<p>“Wis’ I’d punc’ed his head!” came in a
subdued murmur from the bunchy little figure
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton smiled and stroked the red hair
gently. “Next time Pauly will say ‘No,’
that will be better.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the door for Sydney, and
they went out together.</p>

<p>The Vicar brought round the little cart with
its shaggy pony. Sydney got in, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
drove off. From the nursery window a fat
hand was waving to them with an affectation
of great cheerfulness. “Poor little chap!”
said Pauly’s father.</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton was waiting about rather anxiously
on the steps of the Castle, and came
forward with a look of unmistakable relief
as he recognised Sydney.</p>

<p>He shook hands with the Vicar and thanked
him warmly for “bringing home Miss Lisle,”
but Sydney noticed that he did not ask him
to come in. He said that neither Lady
Frederica nor Lord St. Quentin were yet
down, but the servants had been much alarmed
by Sydney’s disappearance. She and Mr.
Seaton between them explained its cause;
Mr. Fenton reiterated his thanks, and the
Vicar got into his pony-cart and drove away,
with a shy hand-shake from Sydney and a
request that he would give her love to little
Pauly.</p>

<p>“Was it wrong to go out for a walk?”
Sydney asked, as she and the old lawyer went
into the Castle.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not wrong, my dear young lady!”
he assured her, “only perhaps rather injudicious.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">LORD ST. QUENTIN</span></h2>

<p>By the time she had been a week at Castle
St. Quentin, Sydney felt as though the old
happy life in London were years away.</p>

<p>She did not even look like the same Sydney,
in the dainty frocks with which Lady Frederica
replaced the clothes mother had packed so
carefully.</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle has not a thing fit to wear,
my lady,” had been Ward’s verdict, when
Lady Frederica made inquiries into the state
of Sydney’s wardrobe, and Lady Frederica’s
own dressmaker in London received a lengthy
order marked “Immediate” that very night.</p>

<p>The frocks were all ankle-length. “We
will not put your hair up till you are presented
in March,” said Lady Frederica; but she only
laughed when Sydney threw out a timid suggestion
that perhaps in that case the old frocks
might do till she came out. All these new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
clothes for four months’ use only: it hardly
seemed possible to believe.</p>

<p>Sydney’s wardrobe replenished, Lady
Frederica took her education in hand with
undiminished energy. And the girl, although
of no very studious disposition, quite hailed
the idea of lessons. Something to do would
be indeed a comfort, was the conclusion she
arrived at by the end of the first week. Writing
had lost its zest now she had unlimited time
in which to do it, and even story-books palled
when read all day. Solitary walks were most
decidedly forbidden by Lady Frederica, when
she heard of the girl’s adventure on the
morning after her arrival; and when Mr.
Fenton left the Castle, as he did in a day or
two, her life was lonely indeed.</p>

<p>St. Quentin was worse, and confined to his
room for the whole week, seeing no one but
his man and Dr. Lorry; and Lady Frederica
was never down until the two o’clock luncheon.</p>

<p>If it had not been for a long letter of loving
understanding counsel from mother, Sydney
would have been more than half inclined to
give up the early rising and other old home
ways which made the mornings seem so long.
But mother must not be disappointed in her,
and she thought of Mr. Seaton’s words, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
determined to try hard to make the interests
which did not seem inclined to make themselves.</p>

<p>It was on a dull afternoon a week after
her arrival that she met the doctor as he came
from the library, where St. Quentin had been
reinstalled for the first time since the night
she came.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry was an elderly man, very kind-hearted
and a teller of good stories by the
yard. He held out his hand to Sydney with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Come in and see your cousin for a little
while this afternoon, my dear young lady,”
he suggested. “I think a visitor would do
him good to-day.”</p>

<p>Sydney followed him obediently into the
library—a handsome but rather sombre room,
where what little of the wall could be seen for
well-filled book-cases was covered by Spanish
leather, and the furniture wore the same sober
tint of dark brown.</p>

<p>St. Quentin’s couch was drawn up near the
fire: he looked considerably more ill now
she saw him in daylight. His face was very
worn and his eyes sunken.</p>

<p>“Well, Lord St. Quentin, I’ve brought you
a visitor, you see,” the doctor said, drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the girl forward. “She is not to chatter
you to death—are you a great talker, Miss
Lisle?—but just to quietly amuse you. Good-bye,
I’ll look in again to-night.”</p>

<p>And he went out quietly, with an encouraging
nod of his head to Sydney.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said her cousin. “There, by
the fire; you look cold. You needn’t stay
above five minutes if you find it bores you.”</p>

<p>“But I want to stay,” Sydney said. Her
glance was the direct one of a child. “I have
been wanting to see you to say thank you
for all those lovely things you have given me—in
my rooms, you know. And Lady Frederica
says I am to have a horse, and riding lessons
too. It is <em>awfully</em> good of you!”</p>

<p>She pulled up in confusion at the “awfully”
which had escaped her, but her cousin did not
seem to notice it.</p>

<p>“Oh, you like the notion of a horse; that’s
right,” he said. “I wrote up to Braemuir,
who’s a pretty fair judge, to choose one suited
for a lady, and to send it down. You ought
to look rather well on horseback.”</p>

<p>He looked critically at the slight figure
dressed in soft green, touched with creamy
lace, before him. “I’m glad Aunt Rica didn’t
make you put your hair up yet,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“At home they said I must put it up on my
eighteenth birthday,” Sydney volunteered.</p>

<p>“At ‘home’?” questioned the marquess,
with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I mean in London,” she explained, speaking
rather low. “Mother always said I must not
keep it down after I was eighteen, but Hugh
didn’t want it to go up.”</p>

<p>“Who is Hugh?” St Quentin’s tone was
rather sharp; Sydney wondered if he were
in pain.</p>

<p>“Hugh is the eldest of us, but not a bit
stuck-up or elder-brotherish because of that.
He is such a dear boy and very clever too.
Why, he has an appointment at the Blue-Friars’
Hospital that most men don’t get till they’re
<em>ever</em> so old, over thirty! And Hugh is so nice
too, at home; he and I are special friends——”</p>

<p>Sydney could not understand what made her
cousin’s voice sound so unpleasant as he
interrupted her with another question:</p>

<p>“How old is this paragon?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-four last birthday, Cousin St.
Quentin.” She no longer felt inclined to
enlarge upon Hugh’s merits.</p>

<p>“Does he write to you?”</p>

<p>“Of course he does.”</p>

<p>“Don’t answer his letters, if you please.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
I have no doubt your Chichesters are excellent
people, but a correspondence between you and
this young paragon is most unsuitable.”</p>

<p>The colour flamed into Sydney’s face. “I
don’t know what you mean, Cousin St. Quentin,”
she cried hotly, “and Hugh will think me so—so
<em>horrid</em> if I never answer his letters!”</p>

<p>The cynical smile deepened round his mouth.
“The sooner you understand that playing at
brother and sister is out of the question now
the better,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>Sydney set her teeth to keep the tears back
and stared hard into the fire. She would not
cry before St. Quentin, but his tone, even more
than his words, made her desperately hot and
angry. There was silence in the room for full
five minutes: then the footman came in with a
note for Lord St. Quentin.</p>

<p>He opened it, and read it half aloud with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“What’s this ... ‘Miss Lisle ... help in
the Sunday School ... small class ...’ (confound
the fellow’s insolence!) ‘subject of course
to my approval ...’ (He won’t get that, I can
tell him!)”——</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin St. Quentin!” Sydney cried,
springing to her feet, “is it about my class
in the Sunday School? I told Mr. Seaton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I should like to take one. You will let me,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You know nothing about it!”
he assured her. “You wouldn’t like it, and
I don’t choose you to be always after parsons.
Sit down there at the writing-table—you’ll find
pens and paper—and decline his offer, please!”</p>

<p>“But I promised that I would, Cousin St.
Quentin!”</p>

<p>“Well, now you find you can’t! Write—‘<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir.</span>’”</p>

<p>Sydney wrote obediently, but with rebellion
in her heart.</p>

<p>“I regret to find myself unable to take a
class in your Sunday School,” dictated Lord
St. Quentin. “Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">Sydney Lisle</span>.”</p>

<p>But Sydney paused before the “yours
faithfully” and faced round with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“He was very kind to me, and that sounds
rather rude, doesn’t it? Mayn’t I just put
something else before the signature, for politeness?”</p>

<p>“Oh, say your brute of a cousin won’t allow
you to do anything you want,” the marquess
suggested, with a rather mocking smile.</p>

<p>Sydney reddened, and, without remark,
finished the letter that he had dictated. Then
she directed the envelope to “The Rev. Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Seaton,” and, rising, put it in her cousin’s hand.
“I couldn’t say a thing like that, you know,”
she said, and he noticed that the childish figure
had a dignity of its own. “Shall I ring for
one of the footmen to take it to the Vicarage?”
she added.</p>

<p>“I will,” said her cousin rather sharply,
reaching out his arm. His couch stood rather
farther off from the bell than usual, and he
turned a little on his side in the attempt to
reach it. The next moment Sydney saw him
fall back with a stifled exclamation of suffering,
while his face grew ashen and his brows
contracted. She sprang forward. “Ring
twice for Dickson,” he gasped, “and go!”</p>

<p>She pealed the bell furiously, then, with a
remembrance of father, looked on the little
table beside him.</p>

<p>Yes, sure enough, there was the bottle with,
“Five drops to be taken in water when the
pain is acute.”</p>

<p>The water was there all ready. She held
it to her cousin’s lips, raising his head carefully.
“It is the stuff in the blue bottle, Cousin St.
Quentin. Dickson said you took it when the
pain was bad.”</p>

<p>When Dickson came hurrying in, breathless
with his run from the distant servants’ quarters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
he found his master lying still with closed
eyes, while Sydney dabbed his forehead with
cologne and water.</p>

<p>“Bless me, miss, that ain’t no good!”
gasped the servant, forgetting manners in the
exigency of the moment. “That blue bottle,
please, miss, and the water!”</p>

<p>The strained look was passing from St.
Quentin’s face, and he opened his eyes again.
“It’s all right, Dickson, Miss Lisle has already
given me the dose, as well as any doctor.
Don’t stay now, child; Dickson will look
after me.”</p>

<p>Sydney did not see her cousin again that
evening, but Dr. Lorry looked in and reported
him a little better.</p>

<p>And the next afternoon, as Sydney was
driving through the village by Lady Frederica’s
side in the great landau, Mr. Seaton came up,
and Lady Frederica stopped the carriage to
speak to him.</p>

<p>Sydney, remembering the note she had so
unwillingly written him, grew scarlet and
shrank back into a corner of the carriage, but
he greeted her and Lady Frederica as though
nothing disagreeable had occurred.</p>

<p>Presently he asked, turning to the girl,
“How is Lord St. Quentin to-day? I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it so good of him to write himself and explain
why you cannot help us in the Sunday School
at present.”</p>

<p>“Did Cousin St. Quentin write to you?”
Sydney cried, finding it hard to believe her
ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard from him late last night,
explaining what great things you are going
to do in the way of education, Miss Lisle.
Naturally he does not wish you to undertake
anything more just now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Lisle will be presented in March,
and till that time we are going to educate her,”
broke in Lady Frederica. “I wish we were
not such a frightful distance from London, for
I suppose the Donisbro’ masters will have to
do, unless I carry her off straight to town,
which would be much the best thing to do!”</p>

<p>“Only of course you would not wish to leave
Lord St. Quentin in his present state of health,”
said Mr. Seaton rather pointedly, and Lady
Frederica sighed and said she supposed not,
but these lingering illnesses were very inconvenient.</p>

<p>Then the carriage drove on.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the Castle, Sydney
ran to the library, knocked, and went in. St.
Quentin seemed immersed in a book. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
went and stood beside his couch, her hands
behind her.</p>

<p>“Cousin St. Quentin,” she said, “we met
Mr. Seaton, so I know now that my note did
<em>not</em> go to him.”</p>

<p>“It went into the fire,” said St. Quentin,
without raising his eyes from his book. “Your
hand-writing isn’t precisely a credit to the
aristocracy, you know. You’d better do some
copies before you turn into a marchioness.”</p>

<p>But Sydney was not to be put off by his
tone.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry I was cross,” she said
earnestly. “It was <em>ever</em> so good of you to
write him a nice note instead!”</p>

<p>St. Quentin went on reading in silence for
a minute, then looked up.</p>

<p>“If you are going to remain,” he said, “and
pray do, if you feel inclined, shut the door and
don’t talk nonsense!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">MISS MORRELL</span></h2>

<p>A companion-governess was procured for
Sydney, the daughter of the vicar of one of
the churches near Donisbro’. The girl was
unfeignedly delighted at the prospect of a companion,
even of the rather advanced age, as it
seemed to her, of three-and-twenty.</p>

<p>She grew quite excited over the arranging
of Miss Osric’s room, and would have liked
to decorate it with some of the pretty things
from her own. But this Lady Frederica would
not allow.</p>

<p>“You can have anything you like for her in
reason, child,” she said, “without stripping
yourself. What, you don’t think there are
enough pictures in her room? Well, you may
drive in with Ward to Dacreshaw this afternoon,
and get some, if you like. There is a
good print-shop there. Put the bill down to
St. Quentin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>But that was not necessary, for Sydney
received a summons to the library before she
set out that afternoon.</p>

<p>Her cousin laid his pen down on her
entrance; she saw he had been signing a
cheque.</p>

<p>“I haven’t started you on a dress-allowance,
Sydney,” he said, “because you had better let
Aunt Rica rig you out at present. She knows
how to do the thing, you see. But you’ll want
some money to play with, so there’s your first
quarter.” He held out the cheque.</p>

<p>Sydney gasped. “It isn’t for me, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is; there, put it in your purse.
You can change it at the Bank at Dacreshaw,
where I hear you’re going. Good-bye, don’t
spend it all on chocolates!”</p>

<p>For the first time since her arrival at St.
Quentin Castle, Sydney felt almost happy.
What Christmas presents she could get now
for every one at home! Should she choose
them at Dacreshaw, or wait till she went to
Donisbro’ for the lessons in drilling and deportment
she was to take with a very select
class of girls in the cathedral city?</p>

<p>She sat in a happy dream all through the
drive, and only roused herself when she reached
the print-shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The Castle carriage was known, and the
owner of the shop came forward at once to
serve the young lady, leaving the customer he
had been attending—a tall, graceful girl, some
years Sydney’s senior, with great calm, clear
eyes.</p>

<p>Sydney found the shopman most obliging.
He bowed repeatedly; he seemed willing to
reach down every picture in the shop for her
to look at, regardless of the trouble, and he
asked with real anxiety after the health of “his
lordship, Lord St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>The tall girl had come rather near to them
to examine a picture Sydney had laid down.
She started at the shopman’s question, looked
irresolutely for a minute at the younger girl,
then came across to her with a smile.</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle,” she said, “you will not know
me, but I know Lady Frederica very well,
and have stayed at Castle St. Quentin. I am
Katharine Morrell.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fenton told me about you,” Sydney
said, brightening instantly. Speaking to another
girl felt like meeting a countryman in a
strange and savage land. “Do you live near?”
she added eagerly.</p>

<p>“Some distance off; at Donisbro’,” she said;
“my father is the Dean of Donisbro’ Cathedral.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I hear you are coming to the calisthenic class
at Lady Helmsley’s. Perhaps I shall see
something of you, for I am taking a little
cousin to it.”</p>

<p>“I am <em>so</em> glad you will be there,” Sydney
said, brightening still more. The girl had a
lovely face, she thought, its slight look of sadness
only adding to its beauty. She was like
some bygone saint.</p>

<p>“I am busy choosing a picture,” said Miss
Morrell, “and you are, of course, on the same
errand. I am executing a commission for my
father; perhaps you are for your cousin? By
the way, how is he?”</p>

<p>“He has been worse, but seems better these
last few days,” Sydney answered, rather doubtfully.
“Dr. Lorry never tells us much about
him.”</p>

<p>“They never do,” Miss Morrell said, in a
low voice. “We are left to eat our hearts out
in ignorance, because, forsooth, they think a
woman cannot bear the truth. Oh, how much
easier it would be if we might know, and care,
and be miserable if we wished!”</p>

<p>Sydney felt vaguely puzzled. Miss Morrell
had spoken quietly, but her voice vibrated, as
though the words she spoke were almost forced
from her, and, as she turned away at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
shopman’s approach, the girl saw her hands
were shaking. But, after that outburst, her
manner returned to its usual calm, and she
busied herself with real kindness in helping
Sydney in that difficult thing—choice.</p>

<p>Four charming prints in sepia of well-known
pictures were at length decided on, and the
man managed to fit them with frames from his
store, while Sydney was giving her opinion on
the comparative merits of “The Angelus” in
sepia or black-and-white for the benefit of her
new friend.</p>

<p>“You must come and have some tea with me
at Grayson’s before you drive home,” said Miss
Morrell, when both had paid for their pictures,
and Sydney’s had been placed in the brougham.
“Oh, yes, you must: you cannot possibly be
back at the Castle till long past tea time, and I
have to wait for papa, who is at a meeting.
Tell your maid to go and get tea for herself;
the coachman will know, I expect, if he ought to
put the horses up.”</p>

<p>Greaves evidently thought he had better
do so.</p>

<p>“Very good, ma’am. Call for you in ’arf
an hour, ma’am,” he said, and drove off to the
St. Quentin Arms in the next street.</p>

<p>Sydney soon found herself at home with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Miss Morrell, and the two girls talked happily
over the cream-cakes and fragrant tea for which
Grayson’s of Dacreshaw is noted. Ward drank
hers in the room below with an easy mind.
She had heard enough of Miss Morrell in the
servants’ hall of Castle St. Quentin to feel
certain that there could be no objection to Miss
Lisle associating with her.</p>

<p>Sydney took the larger share in the conversation.
Miss Morrell had a knack of
drawing people out, and the girl found herself
telling of the Chichester family at home, and
making her new friend laugh over funny
anecdotes of Fred and Prissie.</p>

<p>“You must have found it dull at the Castle
just at first, after being used to so large a party,”
Miss Morrell said.</p>

<p>“I did,” Sydney owned frankly, “and I find
it rather dull still. But Lady Frederica is kind
and amusing, and I like—yes—I do quite like,
Cousin St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>Miss Morrell had stooped to pick up the
handkerchief she had dropped while Sydney
was speaking. She took rather a long time
in doing so, and when her head appeared again
there was a lovely colour in her face.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I hear your carriage now, dear,”
she said, rising, “and we must not keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
horses standing, must we? No, put away
your purse; I <em>asked</em> you to tea. I expect
we shall find your maid waiting for you
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“I do hope I shall see you at the calisthenic
class!” Sydney said earnestly, and Miss
Morrell smiled and said she hoped so too.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of Dacreshaw?”
asked Lord St. Quentin, as Sydney peeped
into the library about an hour later, with a
large parcel under her arm.</p>

<p>She came and sat down beside him, and
undid the string with business-like gravity.</p>

<p>“It is a perfectly lovely place!” she assured
him, “and the print-shop is delightful. The
pictures were all so nice that I hardly knew how
to choose among them. Look at that Greuze,
Cousin St. Quentin, isn’t her face just sweet?
I’ve seen the original of that in the Wallace
collection. Hugh took Mildred and Dolly and
me there one day last year.”</p>

<p>“That eternal Hugh!” muttered the marquess,
but beneath his breath, and Sydney
chattered on without hearing.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t settle for <em>ever</em> so long whether to
have the girl with the broken pitcher, or with
the lamb, but Miss Morrell said——”</p>

<p>“<em>Who?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Morrell. She was there in the
shop, Cousin St. Quentin, and oh, she was so
nice! She helped me choose, and we had tea
together. She knows Lady Frederica, but I
don’t think she knows you—she didn’t say so,
but she asked how you were. Why, Cousin
St. Quentin, would you like some more drops,
or shall I ring for Dickson?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want anything or anybody;
it’s all right. Only you had better go off to
Aunt Rica. I’m tired to-night,” he said, turning
away.</p>

<p>She was gathering up her pictures and going
obediently, when he asked, still with his head
averted, “Which did you say was the picture
<em>she</em> liked?”</p>

<p>“The Broken Pitcher,” Sydney answered
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Well, you might leave me one to look at—that
will do—the pitcher one, I mean.”</p>

<p>Sydney propped her Greuze upon the table
where he could see it comfortably, and went
out.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</span></h2>

<p>Miss Osric arrived at the Castle on the
afternoon following Sydney’s expedition to
Dacreshaw.</p>

<p>A carriage was sent to meet the 4 o’clock
train, and Sydney, in spite of an uncomfortably
shy sensation at the bottom of her heart,
begged leave to go and meet her governess.</p>

<p>“Certainly not! it would be most unsuitable!”
said Lady Frederica, in her most decided
manner, and she walked away, leaving Sydney
to wonder why everything she wished to do
was either unsuitable or absurd. The words
were unknown at No. 20, in that dull old square
not far from Euston Station, which was home.</p>

<p>Still, Miss Osric should have a welcome at
the Castle if she could not at the station, and
Sydney hung up the pictures she had bought at
Dacreshaw, and coaxed some lovely hot-house
flowers out of the head-gardener, Macintosh,
to fill the vases in her governess’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Quentin was rather amused by her extensive
preparations. “But you see,” Sydney
remarked, when he made a laughing comment
on them, “Miss Osric may be feeling just as
shy and wretched as I did when I came here,
and it will make a difference if somebody is
really pleased to see her.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you think we were pleased to see
<em>you</em>?” asked her cousin.</p>

<p>“You were all very kind,” Sydney said
doubtfully, “but, you didn’t exactly <em>want</em> me,
did you? It is only at home one is really
wanted.”</p>

<p>She stopped, remembering his snub on the
subject of calling the Chichesters’ house
home; but he only said, with a little smile,
“Well, go and make your governess welcome in
your own way, child. I hear wheels now.”
And, as the girl flew out, her long hair
streaming behind her, he said half aloud, “I
wonder how it would feel to have anyone to
care if one were wretched or no!”</p>

<p>Sydney was on the steps to receive Miss
Osric, and certainly her shy but eager welcome
made a good deal of difference to the feelings
of the young governess, bewildered by this
plunge into the outside world, made for the
sake of the younger ones at home, who needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
better education than her father’s means
allowed. Mary Osric, just returned from a
brilliant career at Lady Margaret Hall, had
begged to be allowed to help towards providing
some of the advantages she had herself enjoyed
for her juniors; and a friend had mentioned
her name to Lady Frederica as that of a clever
girl, likely to fill suitably the double post of
governess and companion to Miss Lisle.</p>

<p>Miss Osric had been considered shy at
College, despite her cleverness, and the idea of
teaching a strange girl in an absolutely strange
place was terrible to her. But she always
declared afterwards that the worst was over
when Sydney came running out into the hall to
welcome her.</p>

<p>“You must be cold!” the girl cried.
“Would you like to come straight to your room
and take your hat off before tea? Let me
carry your umbrella. Be careful how you walk;
the floors are very slippery.”</p>

<p>“It is lovely—just like a picture,” said Miss
Osric, beginning suddenly to feel less homesick.
There was something very winning about
Sydney’s tone.</p>

<p>The room where the new arrival was to
sleep bore traces also of the same care for her
comfort. A bright fire burnt in the grate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a vase of hot-house flowers was on the writing-table,
the pictures from Dacreshaw looked
charming on the walls, and a little book-case
was filled with a selection of Sydney’s best-loved
books.</p>

<p>“What a charming room!” the young
governess exclaimed, and Sydney, colouring
a little, murmured she “was glad Miss Osric
liked it.” She stayed with her governess while
she took off coat, hat, and fur, and then brought
her to the morning-room, where the shaded
lamp shed a delicate rose glow over everything
and the little tea-table was drawn up to the
fire.</p>

<p>“I am so very glad you have come,” said
Sydney, as she poured out tea and handed
muffins, and Miss Osric began to realise that
the duty she had set herself need not necessarily
prove a hard one.</p>

<p>“Well, do you like the mentor?” asked St.
Quentin, as Sydney came into the library to
wish him good-night. “Are you going to be
quite happy now you have another girl to play
with?”</p>

<p>And Sydney, meeting the real anxiety in his
eyes, said “Yes.”</p>

<p>“But she <em>is</em> still hankering after those confounded
Chichesters!” her cousin said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
himself, when the girl had left him, in which
conclusion he was not far wrong.</p>

<p>With the coming of Miss Osric, the “do as
you please” system ceased.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica might be lax as regarded
solid education. “There’s no need whatsoever
to behave as though you are to be a governess,
my dear,” she said to Sydney, but she was
horrified by the girl’s lack of accomplishments.</p>

<p>“The one and only thing the child can do
is to look pretty,” his aunt complained to St.
Quentin, “and beauty without style is very
little good. Of course, we must be thankful
for small mercies—one seldom has big ones
to be thankful for—and she might have been
fat and podgy! But what in the world those
doctor people were about not to give her drill
and calisthenic lessons, I can’t think!”</p>

<p>“There were herds of them, I fancy,” said
her nephew. “Whenever Sydney mentions
them, which isn’t seldom, she springs a new
one upon me. They would make an excellent
third volume to the <cite>Pillars of the House</cite>.
I don’t suppose there was overmuch cash to
spare for accomplishments.”</p>

<p>“I never can think why it is that those
people who cannot afford it always have such
enormous families,” pursued the lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we had done our duty by Sydney as
we should, there would have been one less
all these eighteen years,” her nephew suggested,
and Lady Frederica changed the
subject, as she always did when St. Quentin
had what she called a “conscientious craze.”</p>

<p>“It’s your health makes you talk like that,
my dear boy,” she declared. “You are really
getting quite ridiculous about Sydney!”</p>

<p>The round of accomplishments now began
in good earnest.</p>

<p>Sydney and Miss Osric breakfasted at eight-thirty,
after which, when the weather was at
all possible, Sydney took her ride on her new
mare “Bessie,” a charming creature, whom
she learned to love! Even Lady Frederica
owned that, after a few lessons from old Banks,
who had taught the present marquess to ride
long ago, Sydney passed muster well enough
on horseback. She and Bessie understood
each other, and she bade fair to make a graceful
and a fearless horsewoman.</p>

<p>“Of course she can ride; all the Lisles
can ride anything that has a back to it,” St.
Quentin said, when Lady Frederica condescended
to approve the girl’s horsemanship;
but, though his tone was careless, there was
no doubt he was gratified by the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his young cousin took after the family in that
respect.</p>

<p>On three mornings in the week Sydney
had masters from Donisbro’ for French, piano,
and singing, and every Saturday a sergeant
with a huge black moustache came to teach her
fencing in the long “Gallery-at-Arms,” where
the third marquess of St. Quentin was said to
have fought a duel with the famous Duke of
Marlborough one wild morning when a stormy
dawn peered through the mullioned windows,
and to have spared his life as being host.</p>

<p>Sydney came to enjoy her lessons, as soon
as she had grown used to the strange sensation
of having every bit of instruction to herself,
with only Miss Osric sitting by to chaperone
her pupil.</p>

<p>She had a fresh young voice of no special
power, nor was her playing in the least above
the average. She longed that Dolly, who
would do her teachers so much more credit,
might enjoy these music lessons in her stead;
but the wish was futile.</p>

<p>She and Miss Osric lunched at two with
Lady Frederica, and, if possible, managed a
brisk walk before lunch. Miss Osric was as
energetic as Sydney herself, and always ready
to go out, whatever the weather. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
they had only time for a stroll in the Park, but
often extended it to the picturesque little
village, where the broken-down cottages, with
their moss-covered thatch and ivied walls, made
Miss Osric long for the summer and time for
sketching.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Lady Frederica generally
liked a companion on her drive and took
Sydney, but the girl always managed to find
a few minutes to run into the library to see her
cousin; who, except on his worst days, was
wheeled from his bedroom to the library next
door about two o’clock.</p>

<p>After the drive there was tea, then usually
another visit to St. Quentin, followed by
practice, preparation for her masters, and
finishing, not infrequently, with something she
and Miss Osric were reading together.</p>

<p>They dined at eight with Lady Frederica,
and afterwards sat in one of the drawing-rooms
till 9.30, when Sydney was despatched to bed.</p>

<p>This was rather a come-down after ten
o’clock bed-time at home, but Lady Frederica
was firm on that point.</p>

<p>“I am here to turn you into the right kind
of girl for your position,” she explained to
Sydney, “and one of the most important things
for it is a good complexion. I went to bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at seven every night of my life till I was
seventeen and came out, and I don’t think
there was a complexion to match mine in
London. Yours will never equal it, my dear,
though St. Quentin does say silly things about
you. Yes, my complexion was perfect, and so
was my way of entering a room (you poke,
rather!) and getting in and out of a carriage;
and though I never could remember why
Romeo wrote Juliet, or whether Chaucer or
Pope was the author of ‘In Memoriam,’ I
married Tim Verney, the millionaire, at the end
of my first season!”</p>

<p>Poor Sydney used to listen to such conversations
with a vague and increasing sense of
discomfort. Was this to be her life, only this?
Was this where all the accomplishments were
leading? Was this, only this, what mother
had meant by “making the best in every sense
of this new life”?</p>

<p>Sydney felt quite sure that it was not!</p>

<p>She grew graver and distinctly more homesick;
St. Quentin noticed the change in her,
and put it down to rather too many lessons.
By his decree the ride was lengthened; but
it was something more than mere amusement
that poor Sydney wanted. Perhaps the want
she was most conscious of herself was mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The drill and fencing lessons were supposed
to give the girl that “deportment” of which
Lady Frederica spoke so constantly, but she
was herself Sydney’s most effective teacher.
The girl grew very weary of the constant
instructions. “Don’t run downstairs, Sydney!—never
seem in a hurry. My dear, don’t
shake hands that way. Miss Osric, kindly give
her your hand again. No, that’s not right!
Dear me! I think they might have taught you
such a simple thing as to shake hands gracefully
at your doctor’s.”</p>

<p>If Sydney failed in any way, Lady Frederica
was surprised that she had not been taught
better at “the doctor’s.” It made the girl
grow hot with indignation for the dear home
people, but she was quite aware that Lady
Frederica would only raise her eyebrows and
say, “Gracious, child, don’t be absurd!” if
she expressed a tithe of what she felt.</p>

<p>The bi-weekly calisthenic lessons came as a
welcome relaxation. The drive to Donisbro’
was in itself a pleasure, for, after the first
novelty had worn off, Lady Frederica sent
Miss Osric with her pupil.</p>

<p>The class comprised only about a dozen
girls between the ages of fourteen and nineteen,
who met at a private house and were taught by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a master who bestowed instructions upon
royalty.</p>

<p>It felt like meeting an old friend to Sydney
to see Katharine Morrell’s clear-cut face and
calm eyes among the mothers and governesses,
and she enjoyed introducing Miss Osric and
telling eagerly the unimportant little details of
her daily life to an ear which was always
sympathetic.</p>

<p>She began to look forward to Tuesdays and
Fridays as the best days in the week, and
save up the nicest bits of news to tell Miss
Morrell—Hugh’s last success—Madge’s Latin
prize at the High School—or some kindness
shown her by St. Quentin.</p>

<p>Katharine Morrell seemed interested in all
and everything that Sydney had to tell, <em>even</em>
in the news of the Castle, which seemed to
its teller so infinitely less worth hearing than
the doings of the Chichesters and home.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE HEIRESS-APPARENT</span></h2>

<p>On a clear, cold December evening a month
after Sydney’s arrival, the grand old castle
of St. Quentin seemed to have cast off for the
moment its habitual sombreness.</p>

<p>Sounds of talk and laughter came from the
brilliantly-lit dining-room, and the great hall,
though empty still, was gay with flowers—great
pots of chrysanthemums and arum lilies
standing against walls where more than one
cannon ball was embedded.</p>

<p>On this night Lord St. Quentin had elected
to give a dinner to his principal tenants, and
afterwards to formally present Sydney to them
as his heir.</p>

<p>It was in vain Dr. Lorry urged that excitement
was bad for his patient; it was in vain
Sydney begged to be excused the ordeal.
The Lisles of history had been renowned
for their obstinacy in the days when half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Castle had been shattered by cannon, and
the present head of the house was not behind
his ancestors in that respect.</p>

<p>“The child has been brought up in a
corner,” he said, “but her acknowledgment
is going to be as public as I can make it.
The tenantry may just as well know something
of her before she comes to rule over them.”</p>

<p>So the preparations were made and the
guests bidden.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica groaned a good deal over
“St. Quentin’s fads,” as she called them. “If
he wants to entertain, he might just as well
have consulted <em>my</em> pleasure by giving a dinner
or a dance to our own set,” she complained;
“but to expect me to be enthusiastic over
the coming of a lot of old farmers is a little
too much!”</p>

<p>Sydney did not remember that St. Quentin
had asked Lady Frederica to be enthusiastic,
or indeed <em>be</em> anything except <em>be</em> there, but
of course she did not say so.</p>

<p>Lord St. Quentin asked his cousin Lord
Braemuir to come down to stay at the castle,
and take the head of the table at the
dinner.</p>

<p>He was a bluff, hearty-looking man, and
Sydney took a fancy to him because he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
kindly of her young mother and father, and
seemed to think they had been hardly treated.</p>

<p>“I never could see the girl was to blame,”
he told St. Quentin, when they were alone
together. “She was a child and poor Frank
was another, and if only Gwenyth had let
well alone, there would have been no harm
done. But perhaps it was just as well she
did interfere, for you’ve got a charming little
girl for your heir, Quin, my boy. Well, how
things turn out! Fancy little Miss Henderson’s
child coming to be Marchioness of St. Quentin!”</p>

<p>The ladies dined in the library with St.
Quentin that night—Lady Frederica very
magnificent in green and gold, with the Verney
topazes gleaming in her hair. Sydney was
all in white, and wore no jewelry. Lady
Frederica was rigid in her views upon the
etiquette of dress for girls not yet “out.”</p>

<p>The girl had insensibly improved very much
during the past month in style and dignity.
She held herself better, and had grown to be
considerably less shy. St. Quentin watched
her with approval as she sat down after dinner
beside Miss Osric, and began a low-toned
conversation, which should not interfere with
Lady Frederica’s rather high-pitched stream
then flowing over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>She was looking very pretty too, he thought;
with a colour in her small delicately-cut face
and an earnest look in the great grey eyes.
“Yes, Braemuir was right,” he thought to
himself, “I <em>have</em> got a very charming heir!”</p>

<p>Steps were heard outside, and Lord Braemuir
entered, sending his jolly voice before him.
“Are you ready, Quin, my boy, and you, my
dear? Yes, dinner went off splendidly, St.
Quentin, and your farmers quite appreciated
it, I assure you. Where is the presentation
to take place? Oh, the great hall, is it?
Here, shall I wheel your couch in?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, ring for Dickson, please,” said
St. Quentin. “Will you go and bring the
tenants to the hall, Braemuir, and then come
back here and take in Aunt Rica. Sydney,
walk beside my couch, please—don’t be
frightened—nobody shall eat you!”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” said Sydney, drawing
herself up, and they went into the great hall
together, she walking by his side.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica followed, on the arm of
Lord Braemuir, and Mr. Fenton, who had
come down for this great occasion, gave his
to Miss Osric.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon the girl as she
walked slowly up the hall, her colour coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and going, but showing otherwise no sign
of nervousness. They came to the great fireplace
and there stopped. St. Quentin raised
his head a little, and spoke, his hand on
Sydney’s.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I’m very glad to see
so many of you here to-night. You all know,
I think, why I asked for the pleasure of your
company when I am incapable of entertaining
you myself. It is to present to you my cousin
and heir, Miss Lisle.”</p>

<p>Several people cheered at this point, and
Mr. Fenton rubbed his hands together with
a little smile. He detected the undercurrent
of pride in St. Quentin’s voice at having such
an heir to present. And he remembered well
enough the tone in which the marquess had
said, only five weeks ago, “We <em>must</em> have
the girl here, I suppose!”</p>

<p>“A good many of you here to-night will
remember her father, Lord Francis,” St. Quentin
went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” was heard on many sides.</p>

<p>“Well, Fate and my motor-car between
them, have put the title into Miss Lisle’s
hands,” pursued the marquess. “I shouldn’t
altogether wonder if she makes a better hand
of the landlord business than I’ve done, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
her time comes to govern for herself. Gentlemen,
I have much pleasure in presenting you
my heir.”</p>

<p>One sentence in St. Quentin’s speech was
standing out in Sydney’s mind, and repeating
itself over in her head, making her deaf for the
moment to all else going on around her. “I
shouldn’t wonder if she makes a better hand of
the landlord business than I’ve done.” Then
there was something she was called upon to
do in this new life, besides moving gracefully
and shaking hands in the newest manner! St.
Quentin had to touch her on the arm to rouse
her attention to his next remark.</p>

<p>“Will Mr. Hudder be good enough to come
forward? Miss Lisle will like to shake hands
with our oldest tenant. Mr. Hudder held his
farm in my grandfather’s time, Sydney,” he
explained to her.</p>

<p>Sydney did not feel quite certain as to the
proper procedure in such a case. She went
forward and put her hand in the old farmer’s
great brown one. “I am so pleased to meet
you, Mr. Hudder.”</p>

<p>The old man retained the little hand, and
slowly shook it up and down. “Man and boy
I’ve held my farm under the Marquesses of St.
Quentin, miss,” he said solemnly. “They’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
been good landlords to me, and I’ve been a
good tenant to them. I’m very pleased to see
you here among us, miss; though I’ll not deny
but that we <em>did</em> hope to see his lordship there,
marry and bring up a family at the old place
and——”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said a voice from behind the
tapestry, and a gentleman, in a faultless overcoat,
drew it aside and walked across the polished
floor. The old farmer dropped Sydney’s hand
in some confusion: the new-comer took a
comprehensive glance around him through the
monocle screwed into one of his rather cold
blue eyes. “Hope I don’t intrude?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the Castle’s owner, “glad
to see you.” But the smile which had been
upon his face, as he watched Sydney and the
old man, disappeared.</p>

<p>The monocle located the couch by the fire:
the new visitor went towards it with outstretched
hand. “Hullo, Quin, heard you got
smashed up!” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, now you see for yourself,” was the
dry answer.</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry—quite cut up about it,” he
explained; “thought several times of dropping
you a postcard to inquire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really?” said the marquess; “but one
could hardly expect such a literary effort from
you. Aunt Rica, may I introduce Bridge, I
don’t think you know each other. Sir Algernon
Bridge—Lady Frederica Verney—Miss Lisle.
Now, my dear chap, you’d better go and dine.
Braemuir, you’ll look after him, as I can’t,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>Lord Braemuir had been standing apart
since the entrance of this fresh guest, with
an unusually grave expression on his good-humoured
face.</p>

<p>At St. Quentin’s words he came slowly
forward, and gave his hand to the new-comer,
still without a smile. “How are you, Bridge?”
he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">A MEETING</span></h2>

<p>Sydney saw considerably less of her cousin
after the arrival of Sir Algernon.</p>

<p>He announced that he had come to spend
Christmas, much to the relief of Lady Frederica,
who declared it would be “such a comfort
to have somebody to amuse St. Quentin.” He
himself acquiesced in the arrangement without
saying much, or expressing pleasure or the
reverse.</p>

<p>The new inmate of the Castle was distinctly
an addition to its liveliness. He and Lady
Frederica had several acquaintances in common,
and Sydney and Miss Osric, sitting quietly
at the dinner-table, found their ideas of various
distinguished persons most uncomfortably disarranged.
Sir Algernon had a knack, however,
of suiting his conversation to his company.
When he overtook Sydney and her governess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
returning from taking soup to a sick child
in the village, he walked between them,
talking very pleasantly of the historical associations
and romantic stories connected with
St. Quentin Castle—a subject particularly interesting
to Sydney, who was beginning to
feel a certain pride in the past of the grand
old house to which she belonged.</p>

<p>It may be presumed that his conversation
pleased St. Quentin also, for his guest was
shut up with him a good deal in the library,
smoking and talking.</p>

<p>In other ways besides amusing conversation,
Sir Algernon’s presence was a boon to the ladies.
He was a first-rate whip, and the four-in-hand
which St. Quentin used to drive was had out
from the stables—where it and his shattered
motor-car had stood so long idle together—for
the benefit of Sir Algernon. He took Lady
Frederica and Sydney out in it: one day
they even went as far as Donisbro’ and
lunched at the principal hotel there.</p>

<p>Sydney wished to lunch at the Deanery,
that she might return a book Miss Morrell
had lent her, but this Lady Frederica would
not allow.</p>

<p>“If you will solemnly swear not to go into
the Deanery drawing-room on any excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
whatsoever, I shall be delighted to escort you
to the door, Miss Lisle,” Sir Algernon suggested
good-naturedly, noticing the way her face fell
at Lady Frederica’s refusal. “We shouldn’t
take above twenty minutes getting there and
back, if you only leave the book at the door.
If Lady Frederica will allow us, we will go
directly after lunch, while she is choosing
those cards she spoke of.”</p>

<p>Lady Frederica agreed readily enough to
this arrangement, and the two set out together
when their lunch was over, with a parting
direction on her part, “Be sure you hurry,
for the afternoons are so short, and we must
start early on our homeward drive.”</p>

<p>They left the parcel with the Deanery
footman, and retraced their steps through
the Close and up the steep High Street of
Donisbro’.</p>

<p>The shops were very gay with Christmas
cards and presents: Sir Algernon inquired
if Miss Lisle still retained a taste for turkey
and plum-pudding? She answered absently,
for the Christmas preparations brought back
home with a painful clearness. She thought
of the shopping expeditions which became
so many as Christmas Eve drew on, and the
numberless secrets with which the tall old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
house seemed packed from garret to cellar,
and the wild excitement of Christmas Eve;
when all the boys and girls who might
be trusted to be quite conformable, went
out to see the brilliant show of Christmas
shops under the guardianship of Hugh and
Mildred.</p>

<p>“What’s the girl thinking of?” Sir Algernon
asked himself, a little piqued, for he was not
used to having his remarks received with
inattention or indifference.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a light dawned on him, for
Sydney’s eyes, which had been fixed rather
absently upon the sloppy pavement before her,
grew bright with recognition. She broke into a
cry of joy, and in a second had sprung forward
to seize both the outstretched hands of a young
man, who was hurrying down the street towards
her. “Oh, Hugh! Hugh!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Sir Algernon let out between
his teeth, as he stood aside, forgotten by
both.</p>

<p>“Hugh! what <em>are</em> you doing at Donisbro’?”</p>

<p>“Sir Anthony had an operation to perform
here,” Hugh explained, “and, like the brick
he is, took me as his anæsthetist. I never
thought of this luck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh! how are they all? How is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
mother? Oh, dear! there are such hundreds
of things I want to ask you!”</p>

<p>“I’m just the same. How are you, dear?
Your letters are jolly, but they don’t tell a
quarter that we want to know. You’re looking
well.” The old brotherly approval in his
eyes was replaced, the girl saw, by a new
expression. “Who are you with? Are you
driving, or what? Can I walk with you?
You mustn’t stand in this cold.”</p>

<p>“No, I am sure Miss Lisle should not,”
Sir Algernon interpolated suavely. “Mr.
Chichester, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Hugh bowed and apologised. Sydney introduced
the two in form, with a loving pride
in speaking Hugh’s name which did not escape
the baronet.</p>

<p>“We ought to be rejoining Lady Frederica,
don’t you think?” he said to her; “we were
ordered not to linger.”</p>

<p>“I forgot,” said Sydney. “Yes, we must
go. Hugh, come too. I want to show you
to Lady Frederica.”</p>

<p>And Hugh, against his better judgment,
came. It was hard to refuse Sydney anything
when the sweet face looked at him so earnestly.
Besides, at home they would be hungry for
news; how could he help saying yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>He walked beside her, but confidences were
impossible in the presence of Sir Algernon,
although that gentleman made himself exceedingly
agreeable according to his wont. Still,
Hugh could look at Sydney and hear her speak,
and that was something.</p>

<p>They reached the hotel all too soon. Lady
Frederica was looking out for them and the
introduction was made. She was civil, but
by no means cordial, and conveyed an accent
of disapproval into her polite surprise at seeing
Mr. Chichester so far from town.</p>

<p>Sydney explained eagerly, but Lady Frederica’s
“Indeed!” was discouraging, and there
was a pause. Hugh felt he was expected to
take his leave, and took it.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Sydney, I’m—awfully glad to
have seen you.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye, Hugh—my love
to them at home, a great <em>deal</em> of love, you
know, Hugh. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>Oh, dear! how much there was that Sydney
wanted to say to him! If only Lady Frederica
would have left them for a little time alone! If
only Sir Algernon had not been there when they
met! She wanted—oh, so much!—to hear the
little things that letters never tell; those little
items of everyday home news for which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
felt so sick with longing suddenly. Why hadn’t
she asked this, that, and the other? She
seemed to have said nothing but good-bye.
She was very quiet upon the homeward drive,
so quiet that Sir Algernon looked curiously
at her more than once. And when they
reached the castle, and the girl had gone up
to the school-room, he went into the library to
St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“Got any views for that little girl, Quin?”
he asked carelessly, when he had answered his
host’s inquiries as to the conditions of the
roads, the “pace of the greys,” and other
details of their day.</p>

<p>“Possibly, but none that I need your advice
upon, thanks,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Don’t get riled, old man, I wasn’t offering
it.” Sir Algernon lit a cigarette with great
care and sat down by the fire. “It strikes
me that she has views of her own, as well,”
he concluded.</p>

<p>“Suppose we leave Sydney out of the conversation,
altogether!” said St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“Oh, just as you please, of course. Do you
want the people who brought her up—the
Chichesters—to be a tabooed subject as well?”</p>

<p>“What of them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a son is at Donisbro’, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“One of the Chichesters?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she called him Hugh.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon leaned back luxuriously in his
chair, stretching out his feet to the cheerful
blaze.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that my aunt allowed
the child to enter into conversation with him?”
St. Quentin’s tone was very sharp; Sir
Algernon laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so fierce, old chap. I was the
guilty party, I’m afraid. I was escorting her
back to Lady Frederica after leaving a parcel
with some girl or other, when we ran across
this young chemist’s assistant, or whatever he
is. They fairly rushed into each other’s arms.
I couldn’t interfere very well, you see, though
I did venture to suggest, after a lengthy period
of patient freezing, that there <em>was</em> a limit to
the time he ought to keep her standing in the
street. He walked with us to the hotel, and
there Lady Frederica choked him off. You
needn’t look so furious, Quin, there wasn’t
much harm done; only I fancy Miss Sydney
isn’t quite the pliable little wax saint you think
her, she——”</p>

<p>“Leave her name alone, please!”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well! You’ve grown uncommonly
stand-offish of late, my dear chap; you’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
showing me the door next, eh?” His laugh
was not particularly pleasant.</p>

<p>St. Quentin was frowning heavily. “You
might leave me quiet a bit,” he said. “I’m
not in the best of humours, to-night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said Sir Algernon,
rising and flinging his cigarette away; “it’s
quite unnecessary, I assure you.” And he went
to Lady Frederica in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Would you go to his lordship in the
library, please, ma’am, if quite convenient,” a
footman said, a little later, coming to the
school-room, where Sydney and Miss Osric,
undeterred by the approach of dinner, were
thoroughly enjoying a very late tea.</p>

<p>Sydney put down her cup and got up at
once.</p>

<p>“Are you quite rested now, dear?” asked
Miss Osric. “You looked tired when you
came in, and I am sure, if you are tired still,
Lord St. Quentin would excuse you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m tired,” Sydney said, and
went down the wide stairs and across the hall
to the library.</p>

<p>St. Quentin was alone, but she knew Sir
Algernon had been there by the smell of
smoke. Her cousin’s eyebrows were drawn
close together, and there was a look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
his face which was new to her. He seemed
to have forgotten to smile at her entrance
to-day.</p>

<p>“Come here, Sydney,” he said sharply. “I
have something to say to you. I hear you
met that young Chichester this afternoon.”
His contemptuous tone made the colour
flame into her face.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” she said a little bit defiantly;
“of course I was going to tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” said St. Quentin. “Now,
Sydney, we had better understand each other.
The Chichesters brought you up, and of course
you owe a debt of gratitude to them in consequence.
I have no objection whatsoever to
your paying it—in any reasonable way. I
spoke to Braemuir on the subject when he
was staying here, and he promised me to use
his influence towards getting some of those
boys a start in life. I don’t suppose you know
that, though the estate is by no means as
unencumbered as I could wish, I offered to
refund your doctor what he spent on you in
your childhood, and——”</p>

<p>“He said ‘No,’ of course!” Sydney cried,
with flashing eyes. “Why, I was father’s
child—of course he wouldn’t be paid for keeping
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t indulge in heroics, please; they bore
me,” St. Quentin observed drily. “Yes,
Dr. Chichester—try to drop the expression
‘father,’ please, in speaking of him; it only
makes you sound ridiculous—Dr. Chichester,
I say, refused my offer with some heat. Like
you, he appeared to consider it insulting.
Tastes differ; mine is, as you know, for common
sense. Now, I should be obliged if
you would kindly give me your attention for
five minutes. You are going to occupy a
great position, and I do <em>not</em> intend to have
those Chichesters hanging round you. Those
brother-and-sister friendships are charming in
theory, but they don’t work. I know what
they lead to. I should be obliged if you would
correspond less frequently with the doctor’s
family, and shall request Aunt Rica to see
to it. And I distinctly forbid you to have
anything to do with that young man when
next he <em>happens</em> to be staying in these parts.
Do you understand me?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you want me to <em>forget</em>
mother and father, and all the rest of them
at home?” Sydney cried. There was an odd
expression on St. Quentin’s face, as he watched
the growing indignation upon hers.</p>

<p>“Well, something like it—you won’t find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it very difficult in time, I assure you,” was
his answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to do it!” she said with a
trembling voice. “I shall have to obey you
about not writing so often, or speaking to
Hugh if I meet him, but I can’t and I won’t
forget them! I hate this place! I wish I
had never come, and when you talk like that
I hate you!... I was beginning to care about
you, but I don’t now at all!” She was fighting
to keep back her sobs. “Do <em>you</em> forget the
people you have cared for, that you want
me to?” she asked him fiercely, and went
quickly out.</p>

<p>St. Quentin turned his head and looked
after her.</p>

<p>“Do I forget?” he muttered; “no, I wish
I did!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE CHURCH TOWER</span></h2>

<p>On the morning following the expedition to
Donisbro’, Lady Frederica received an apologetic
note from Herr Felsbaden, Sydney’s
music-master, regretting his inability to give
Miss Lisle her lesson that day, owing to a
severe cold. If convenient to Lady Frederica
and Miss Lisle, he would come to the Castle
on Friday afternoon instead.</p>

<p>The note was sent in to Miss Osric, when
Lady Frederica had glanced through it over
her early cup of tea, and governess and pupil
read it together.</p>

<p>Sydney was looking pale and heavy-eyed
this morning, Miss Osric saw, and guessed
that Lord St. Quentin had said something to
distress the girl. It was a bright sunny morning,
with that exhilaration in the air which only
a perfect winter’s day has the power to give.</p>

<p>“Suppose, as you have no master coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
this morning, we go out for a walk as soon
as we have read a little, Sydney dear?” Miss
Osric suggested. “It is such a lovely morning,
and you look tired. I think the air would
do you good.”</p>

<p>“I have a little headache,” Sydney owned,
and they set out for their walk at about 10.30.</p>

<p>The frost was thick in the park, and every
little twig upon the great bare trees outlined
clearly against a sky of pale cloudless blue.
Sydney wondered why she did not feel the old
exhilaration that a morning such as this would
have once awakened in her, even in smoky
London.</p>

<p>But if she could not enjoy the perfect morning,
they soon met somebody who could!</p>

<p>As they passed the gate of the Vicarage, Mr.
Seaton came out, holding Pauly by the hand.
The child was in a state of absolutely wild
delight, dancing and jumping by his father’s
side, and his eyes glittering like two stars under
the tangle of red hair.</p>

<p>“Going up the great big ’normous tower!”
he informed Sydney, as she stooped to kiss
him. “Going to walk miles and miles and
miles up ladders, almost to the sky!”</p>

<p>The Vicar laughed and shook hands with
both the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have to give some orders about new bell-ropes;
ours were rotten, and I’ve had them
taken down,” he explained. “And it was an
old promise I should take this monkey up the
tower next time I had to go there. Do you
two feel inclined, I wonder, to come with us,
and walk ‘miles and miles and miles up ladders,
almost to the sky’?”</p>

<p>Sydney looked at the tower, standing grey
and tall outlined sharply on the blue, and then
at Miss Osric. “Should you like it? It would
be lovely, I think.”</p>

<p>“We should like to go up very much indeed,
if Mr. Seaton doesn’t mind the bother of us,”
said Miss Osric, and the four went on together
to Lislehurst Church at the farther end of
the village.</p>

<p>The church itself had been rebuilt in the
eighteenth century, when the black oak panelling
had been removed as “dirty-looking” and
replaced by whitewash, and relieved at intervals
by the St. Quentin Arms painted on it in the
gaudiest colours. At the same time, the few
bits of exquisite stained glass which had survived
a visit from the “root and branch” men of the
Commonwealth days had been taken away
to make room for a complete set of crudely
coloured windows, which vexed the soul of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Seaton whenever his eyes fell upon them. But
the old tower had been left intact, and was
considered by the learned to be one of the
finest specimens of fourteenth century architecture
left in England.</p>

<p>There was a tradition that the saintly Bishop
Ken had once climbed it, and had pronounced
the view from the top to be “a foretaste of
Heaven.”</p>

<p>Sydney, when she saw the perpendicular
ladders tied together, which those who went
beyond the belfry chamber were compelled to
climb, doubted privately the probability of anyone
so old and frail as the non-juring Bishop
had grown when he came to Blankshire, having
strength or breath to reach the summit!</p>

<p>“You are not frightened, are you?” asked
the Vicar, when he had given his orders to the
man awaiting him in the belfry chamber, now
emptied of its dangling ropes. “Don’t try it,
if you feel in the least bit nervous, for it <em>is</em> a
stiffish climb!”</p>

<p>To be quite honest, Sydney did not particularly
like the look of the many ladders to
be scaled, but she would have died sooner than
own her fears.</p>

<p>After all, this was not so very much more
difficult than going up the ladders in that oast-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in Kent, where they had gone to see the
men stamp out a hop-pocket, when the whole
family had spent that happy fortnight in a
Kentish farm-house last summer. Only then
Hugh had been there to help her, and pull her
up that awkward step where two rungs had
gone from the ladder. Her back was to the
Vicar, but Miss Osric saw the sudden wistfulness
in the girl’s grey eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, if you really don’t feel
nervous,” Mr. Seaton said. “Oh, Hiram,” as
the old clerk came stumbling down the ladders
at the sound of their voices, “you here? That’s
just as well. Now you can go up in front and
get the little tower door open for the ladies.”</p>

<p>“Gentleman up the tower now, sir,” Hiram
said, touching his battered hat.</p>

<p>“All right; he won’t interfere with us,” the
Vicar said. “Now, Miss Lisle, will you go
first, and take Hiram’s hand where the ladders
cross. Miss Osric, you next. Then Pauly.
Hold tight, you little monkey, or I’ll take you
down again! I’ll bring up the rear, and then
if anybody slips, I’ll catch them.”</p>

<p>The procession started, Mr. Seaton keeping
a firm grip of his small son’s blouse the whole
time, and calling at intervals directions to the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Up, up they went, clinging to the ladders
set perpendicularly against the rough grey
walls, worn with the lapse of time. Higher
and higher still they went, till Sydney and
Miss Osric felt as though they had been
climbing for hours instead of minutes.</p>

<p>The elders had no breath for speech, but
little Pauly chattered unceasingly. “Did these
funny stairs go right up into Heaven? Would
there be angels at the top of the tower?
Would there be stars? Would there be at
least a hole through which Pauly might look
into Heaven when he came so near it?”</p>

<p>Sydney could hear his shrill little voice
talking on, and his father’s grave tones answering
him now and then. As they came higher
the echoes caught up the two voices and
made the old tower ring with them in a way
that sounded strange and very eerie, Sydney
thought.</p>

<p>“Getting tired, Miss Lisle?” called the
Vicar cheerily, as she set foot on the highest
ladder.</p>

<p>His words must have been heard by “the
gentleman” of whom old Hiram had spoken,
for a square of blue and sunshine opened
suddenly above her, and, as she toiled up the
final rungs, a hand, whose touch was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
familiar, grasped hers, and swung her over
that last awkward step, where she seemed to
hang over a yawning black gulf for a moment,
before landing upon terra firma outside the
tower.</p>

<p>“Hugh!” She had forgotten everything for
the moment, except the joy of seeing him
again, but in an instant, like a bitter wind,
her cousin’s words swept back upon her—“I
forbid you to have anything to do with
that young man.”</p>

<p>Hugh could not think why she withdrew
her hand, and went back to the little low
tower door with a cloud on the face that had
been so bright a minute since. “How slow
the others are in getting up!” she said.</p>

<p>Hugh watched her uneasily, as she gave
her hand to Miss Osric and helped her through
the doorway; then proceeded to the same
office for little Pauly. Surely it was very
unlike Sydney to have nothing to say to
him, to be absorbed in these comparative
strangers, when he was at her elbow. Surely
her manner had changed with extraordinary
speed since yesterday.</p>

<p>She on her part had been rapidly considering
the situation. It was plainly impossible
to go down the tower again the very minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
after she had come up it. What excuse could
she make that had the slightest sound of reason?
None, she was quite aware. Plainly the only
thing that she could do was to obey her cousin’s
order in the spirit though not in the letter.</p>

<p>She was rather pale, but her voice was
steady as she bent over little Pauly, devoting
herself to answering his many questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton talked to Miss Osric and to
Hugh, who answered him a little absently.
His eyes were fixed on Sydney. The Vicar
looked from one to the other in a rather puzzled
way from time to time, as he did the honours
of the splendid view that lay before them.</p>

<p>Glimpses of the Castle showed through its
encircling trees, but in summer, Mr. Seaton
said, when all the leaves were out, it was completely
hidden.</p>

<p>He pointed out in succession the quaint
little villages, dotted at intervals about the
valley, with some interesting comment upon
each. There was Loam, which boasted the
finest chancel-screen in the county. Miss
Lisle and Miss Osric ought to see it one of
these bright days: it was most distinctly worth
the trouble of a visit. That tiny church, with
a tower that looked as though some giant had
sat upon it long ago, was Marston. Did Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Chichester remember a humorous account in
the papers two or three years back, of a famous
“kill” which had taken place in Marston
churchyard, when the fox had taken refuge in
one of the old stone box tombs, and held the
narrow entry, worn by age and weather in the
stone, for full an hour?</p>

<p>Styles and Hurstleigh lay out yonder; it
was in Hurstleigh that the Manor stood, which
a loyal lady of the Civil Wars had defended
against General Ireton, till relieved by her
husband just as the little garrison were reduced
to the last straits.</p>

<p>At another time Sydney would have been
immensely interested in the story, but to-day
somehow she could not care even to see the
place where Madam Courtenay caught the
first glimpse of the scarlet mantled horsemen,
riding to her succour only just in time.</p>

<p>She could not put herself to-day into the
place of the cavalier lady and rejoice with her;
she could only feel herself, Sydney Lisle, behaving
in a horrid, stiff, unkind way to the
brother Hugh, who kept looking at her with
those troubled, questioning eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Osric was the only member of the
party who really enjoyed Mr. Seaton’s explanations,
for little Pauly thought them dull to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
last degree. He wanted to know several
things, and no one would attend to his shrill
questions. Sydney was looking where Mr.
Seaton pointed, with unseeing eyes, and his
father took no notice of various impatient tugs
at his hand. Pauly wanted dreadfully to know
why the sky had gone away again, instead of
being quite near as he had expected, and
whether mother and the angels would hear him
if he were to call up to them very loudly, now
this minute, and whether a big man, who was
big enough to lean over the stone parapet of
the tower which his own head barely reached,
could see “In Memory of Rose” on the white
marble cross in the churchyard down below.</p>

<p>Hugh, to pacify him, looked over, and pronounced
that he could see “no end of crosses.”</p>

<p>But this by no means satisfied Pauly. Hugh
must see that special grave where Daddy took
him every Sunday, after service.</p>

<p>“Tell me where to look,” Hugh said; “but
you keep still, young man, if you please.
Don’t you go trying to lean over!”</p>

<p>He stared down. “Is your cross a tall one,
near a tree?” he asked presently. Pauly gave
a bound of delight.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s where ‘In memorwy of Wose’
is. Do you see the lovely holly on the grave?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
I stuck lots in the tin, I did weally, and my
fingers was all bleedy after. I didn’t mind.
Boys don’t mind being bleedy. ’Spect that
big girl that you keep on looking at would
mind. Girls cwy when they’re bleedy, don’t
they? Do you cwy? I s’pose not,’cause
you’re a big man. Did you see my lovely
holly? No, you won’t see where you are.
Oh, look! You can see my lovely holly this
side of the tower as well.”</p>

<p>“I say—stand still!” Hugh said sharply,
turning his head round. Pauly, in a state of
wild excitement, was climbing up the three-foot
parapet as nimbly as a cat. “Get down!”
Hugh shouted, springing to his feet, and darting
over to the child. He spoke too late.</p>

<p>Pauly had reached the top, and was kneeling
on it, peering down upon his “lovely holly.”
“Oh, I can see it! I can see my holly!” he
screamed joyfully, clinging and laughing.</p>

<p>Whether the height turned him giddy, or
he lost his balance by leaning too far, no one
knew. There was only time for a cry of horror,
and a frantic grasp into emptiness upon Hugh’s
part. The child had fallen from the parapet!</p>

<p>The poor father staggered backward, his
hand to his head—the two girls clung together,
speechless; only Hugh was able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
look over. The next moment he was shaking
Mr. Seaton fiercely by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Quick, sir! Down and cut the belfry ropes.
Please God, we’ll save him yet!”</p>

<p>The Vicar, scarcely able to believe his ears,
looked over.</p>

<p>Some nine feet down the tower, at each
corner, a large projecting gargoyle served the
purpose of a water-spout, and it was on one
of these little Pauly had fallen—the creature’s
stone ear having caught his blouse as he
bumped against it in his fall. He was lying
on his back across the gargoyle’s neck, his legs
and head swinging into space, his frock hitched
half across the hideous head. He was still at
the moment, but how long would he remain
so? Below him was a drop of seventy feet.</p>

<p>Hugh flung off his coat, and put his leg
over the parapet. “Hurry with the ropes;
I’ll go to him.”</p>

<p>“No, no, not you!” the Vicar cried. “I
must.”</p>

<p>But Hugh was already letting himself down.
“Quick with the ropes!” was all he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘Quick with the ropes!’ was all he said.”</p>
<p class="caption-r">(<a href="#Page_128">Page 128</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Sydney and Miss Osric looked at one another.
“The belfry ropes are gone!”</p>

<p>Before they had finished speaking, Mr.
Seaton was tearing in a neck-or-nothing fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
down the ladders. It was well for him that
he was forced to act, and not wait to think.
Ropes must be got, and immediately, for what
ladder would be long enough? He did not even
cast one glance back at the tower as he rushed
through the churchyard in search of a rope.</p>

<p>There was nothing that Miss Osric and
Sydney had the power to do but wait and
pray. They clung to one another silently,
with set, white faces, as Hugh commenced his
difficult and dangerous descent, with one eye
on the little figure, which might move and be
dashed from its precarious resting-place at any
moment. Was the child stunned? Hugh
almost hoped he might be. Any movement
must almost certainly be fatal to his balance.</p>

<p>But as the young man felt carefully his
third step in that perilous climb, there was a
quiver in the dark blue bundle on the gargoyle,
and a scared little face was uplifted to his.
The hearts of the girls above stood still.</p>

<p>Hugh was struggling desperately for a foothold
which it seemed impossible to find.
Would the child move, or look down? Should
he do so, nothing could save him.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, old chap!” Hugh called in
his cheeriest tone. “You just keep still where
you are. Yes, that’s right; now look at me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I’m coming down to take you up again. No,
don’t try and sit up—you can see me splendidly
from where you are.”</p>

<p>His voice broke off, as he all but lost both
hold and footing. He regained it with a frantic
struggle and descended another step. “Look
at me, Pauly!”</p>

<p>Pauly’s round eyes gazed up wonderingly.
Hugh neared the gargoyle, and set his teeth
for a mighty effort.</p>

<p>Pauly was a particularly large and strong
boy for not quite five years old, and, even on
firm ground, would be no joke to lift in one
hand. But the thing must be done. Hugh
strengthened his hold with his right hand, and
took an anxious downward glance. Some of
the village men were trying to join ladders,
but they were far too short. Mr. Seaton was
running frantically up the road beyond the
churchyard, with a coil of rope on his arm.
In the clear air Hugh could see his upturned
face, dead white, with eyes staring wildly.</p>

<p>He could not possibly get through the
churchyard and up the tower in less than ten
minutes—Hugh thought he would probably
take longer. It was not therefore possible to
risk leaving Pauly on the gargoyle till he himself
should have the help of a rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>He took the firmest grip he could of the
roughened stonework of the tower with feet
and right hand, and loosed cautiously the other,
reaching with it towards the blue bundle on
the gargoyle. “Steady, Pauly, keep quite still,
old chap!”</p>

<p>With a struggle that brought beads of perspiration
out upon his forehead and nearly sent
him flying into space, he grasped the child,
and raised him slowly from his resting-place;
then stepped down on to the gargoyle, and
stood there, clasping Pauly closely, and leaning
back against the wall with closed eyes.</p>

<p>He was too physically exhausted with the
terrible anxiety and effort of the last few
minutes to make any further movement then.
Besides, it was now a necessity to wait for
the rope. The upward climb would be impossible
when burdened by the well-grown boy.</p>

<p>He had to concentrate all his powers on
keeping steady on the slender foothold, which
was all the gargoyle afforded, and waiting for
the help which Mr. Seaton would bring.</p>

<p>It seemed hours before a shout from above
came down cheerily to him, and a rope end
struck him on the shoulder. “Now, Pauly,”
he said, “hold on round my neck for all you’re
worth, there’s a good little chap!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He took a firm grip of the child’s blouse in
his teeth, and, steadying himself with infinite
difficulty, fastened the rope beneath his own
arms, in the strongest knots that he could
make. Then, using his hands as a trumpet,
he called “Ready!”</p>

<p>His left arm was round Pauly, his right
grasped the rope above his head. “Now hold
tight, little chap, and don’t be frightened!”</p>

<p>Pauly carried out this order by taking as
good a grip as the hair-cutter allowed of Hugh’s
head, and it was in this position that the two
were at length hauled over the parapet by the
united strength of the Vicar, Hiram, and the
Vicarage gardener, whom Mr. Seaton had met
while searching for a rope.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton wrung Hugh’s hand in silence,
and held his son to him, in silence also. No
one seemed to have much voice for speech
just then; even Pauly was subdued and shaken
by his fall, though he had escaped with nothing
worse than grazed knees.</p>

<p>The descent from the tower was very quiet
and sober. A strong shudder went through
the party as they passed the belfry chamber
and thought about the awful moment when
they had realised that the ropes were gone.</p>

<p>His father carried Pauly, and Hugh went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in front of Sydney and Miss Osric, and gave
them his hand where the ladders turned. He
and Sydney never spoke the whole way down.</p>

<p>They were in the churchyard at last, and
Pauly was demanding to be shown “the funny
little step where me and him was standing.”
The Vicar, shivering, hushed him, and turned
to Hugh. “You’ll come in and lunch with
me?” he said, a little huskily, his hand upon
the young man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will,” Hugh answered
gravely.</p>

<p>“And, Sydney, we must hurry back,” Miss
Osric suggested. “I am sure it is getting late.”</p>

<p>Sydney moved a step away; then took a
sudden resolution.</p>

<p>She went to Hugh and held out her hand.
“Good-bye, Hugh. <em>Please</em> understand,” she
said very low.</p>

<p>Hugh took the little gloved hand in his, and
read rightly the trouble in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s all right—don’t you bother, Syd,” he
said. “I understand.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">MERRY CHRISTMAS</span></h2>

<p>“What a lot of times I seem to have said
‘Merry Christmas’ this afternoon!” Sydney
remarked as she and Miss Osric went round
the village in Sydney’s little pony carriage with
the pair of lovely little bay ponies she so much
enjoyed driving. “And the sad thing is, that
nobody here seems to feel particularly happy,”
she went on. “Mrs. Andrews, to whom I
took that crossover just now, said—‘It was
hard enough to feel joyful when her man was
bent double with rheumatism from the dampness
of his cottage!’ Miss Osric, <em>are</em> the
cottages in very bad repair here? Lord
Braemuir seemed to think so, and so do the
people who live in them. But when I asked
Lady Frederica she said—‘Poor people always
grumbled; if it wasn’t one thing, it was sure
to be another!’ What do you think?”</p>

<p>Miss Osric hesitated for a little while before
replying.</p>

<p>“Well, Sydney,” she said at length, “I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
know whether I ought to tell you this, but it
seems to me right you should know something
of the cottages on the estate. It will be your
business to know by-and-by. You know my
father is chaplain to the hospital at Donisbro’,
and he has often told me that the amount of
cases coming from the cottages on this estate
is appalling. People have been brought to the
hospital from Loam and Lislehurst, and even
Styles, where the ground is higher, simply
crippled with rheumatism, and off and on there
have been a good many cases of diphtheria and
fever. That doesn’t speak well for the cottages,
you know.”</p>

<p>Sydney pulled up the ponies in the middle of
the road.</p>

<p>“I shall ask Mr. Fenton,” she said slowly;
“I don’t think I could ask St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>“I think asking Mr. Fenton is not at all a
bad idea,” Miss Osric said cordially; “but, my
dear Sydney, we mustn’t dawdle here in the
cold even to discuss points of duty. Have you
any more presents to distribute?”</p>

<p>“Just one for Pauly at the Vicarage,” the
girl said, gathering up the reins again; “that
is the parcel underneath the seat that you said
took up as much room as we did. It’s a horse
and waggon—a horse with real hair—and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
think Pauly will be able to get himself into the
waggon if he tucks his legs up. I’m sure he
will be pleased—the darling!”</p>

<p>“I wonder how long that quarter’s allowance
is going to last,” laughed Miss Osric, as they
turned the ponies’ heads up the drive to the
Vicarage. “You’ve been so lavish over Christmas
presents, Sydney; that parcel for London
alone must have nearly ruined you!”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> rather near bankruptcy,” owned
Sydney. “It is shocking to confess, but I
never had such a lot of money to spend in my
life, and I went and spent it. But I am not a bit
sorry,” she concluded, “for, just for once, they
will have at home exactly what they wanted.”
Pauly had seen them coming from the window
of his father’s study, against which he was
flattening his small round nose till it looked
exactly like a white button. He flew to the
door and cast himself upon them in the hall
with a shriek of delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you know, it’s going to be Chwistmas
Day to-morrow!” he exclaimed, “and I am
going to church in the morning like a big man,
and Santa Claus is coming in the night, daddy
finks, to put fings in my stocking, ’cause I’ve
been a very good boy for years and not runned
away or been lostened!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vicar, too, was not behindhand in his
welcome, though he was not quite so conversational
as his little son.</p>

<p>“Come into the study, both of you,” he said;
“we’ve got a real Yule log there, haven’t we,
Pauly?—such a monster!—and I’m sure you
must be frozen.”</p>

<p>The Sydney of six weeks ago would have
accepted Mr. Seaton’s offer, but the Sydney of
to-day had learned to think what would annoy
her cousin and Lady Frederica.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we must hurry back, mustn’t we,
Miss Osric?” she said. “We shall be rather
late as it is. We have been all round the
village, wishing ever so many people a happy
Christmas, so we must only just wish the same
to you, and ask you to tell Santa Claus to see
if he can’t find a rather large, knobby parcel in
the corner of the hall for Pauly, when he comes
to visit you to-night.”</p>

<p>“It’s very good of you,” said the Vicar.
“Pauly, don’t tear Miss Lisle’s clothes to
pieces in your joy. You spoil him, you know,
Miss Lisle, if you will allow me to say so.
Well, if you must go, a very happy Christmas
to you both! You are going the right way
to make it a happy one, I think.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Seaton, one thing,” Sydney asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
as they went through the hall together. “Are
the people miserable here because their cottages
want rebuilding?”</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton looked at the earnest face beside
him, and wondered if the wish to help her
poorer neighbours would continue when she
had the power.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I am sorry to own that
most of the cottages here are in a very
neglected condition. But landlords have no
easy time of it, I know, and often lack the
means to do all they want.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Sydney, and then she
kissed little Pauly, and she and Miss Osric
got into the carriage and drove away, the
Vicar watching them, with his small son,
riotous and conversational, on his shoulder, till
they turned out into the road again.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever knew anybody more
devoted to a child than that man is,” said
Miss Osric, as they reached the lodge gates.
“What would he have done if he had lost
him the other day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk about that dreadful morning!”
said Sydney with a shiver.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica had no love for Christmas.</p>

<p>“One is expected to be so aggressively
cheerful and social,” she complained, “when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one is really feeling bored to extinction!
And now St. Quentin’s illness casts a gloom
over everything; it is most absurd to attempt
any feeling of festivity. He wouldn’t like it
at all.”</p>

<p>“Did Cousin St. Quentin care for Christmas
when he was well?” Sydney asked a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I remember one year, when both
his father and mother were alive, they had
the regular old-fashioned sort of Christmas,
and he certainly seemed to enjoy it. The
Dean of Donisbro’ and his daughter Katharine
were here, I remember. The Dean had
slipped upon a slide some tiresome boy had
made when he came over to dine here the
week before Christmas, and he fell and sprained
his ankle. Of course Dr. Lorry wouldn’t let
him travel, so St. Quentin got poor dear Alicia,
his mother, to go to Donisbro’ herself and
bring back Miss Morrell to spend Christmas
with her father. There were only those two,
you see. My dear, Katharine Morrell <em>was</em>
a pretty girl in those days! You’ve seen her,
haven’t you? but she has gone off a good
deal. I fancy St. Quentin admired her rather,
but it didn’t come to anything, though we
all thought it would that Christmas-time. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
she was a good deal too strait-laced for him,
I expect; not that he was worse than other
young man, but he ran through a lot of money
on cards and racing, and annoyed his poor
father very much. Oh! Sir Algernon, is that
you?” (Sir Algernon had entered at the
moment). “I was telling Sydney of that
Christmas when the Dean and Miss Morrell
were here. I forget if you have met Katharine
Morrell?”</p>

<p>Sydney saw a strange expression cross the
handsome face for a moment. But in a
second he had answered in his usual rather
languid accents, “Yes, I know her slightly;
very slightly.”</p>

<p>Christmas Day dawned clear and sunny
and Sydney, as she stood beside Lady
Frederica in the Castle pew at Lislehurst
Church, felt something of the joy of Christmas
coming to her, even in this strange place.
She smiled across at little Pauly, who, standing
beside Mr. Seaton’s housekeeper, was singing,
“Hark! the herald angels sing” with all his
might, and to a time and tune quite his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton’s sermon was very short; he
said he thought the Christmas hymns and
carols preached a better sermon than he had
the power to do. He only asked his people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to remember that next to God’s glory, the
angels had set peace and goodwill upon earth.
The second followed on the first. He wanted
all those who had to-day been glorifying God
for His great Christmas Gift, to see to it
that peace and goodwill was not lacking in
that small part of God’s earth that concerned
each—his or her own home.</p>

<p>Sydney had not seen her cousin since her
outburst on the subject of the Chichesters,
and her conscience pricked her. It was true
that St. Quentin had expressed no wish to see
her, but she had made no attempt to find
out if he had one unexpressed. Surely the
first move towards that peace and goodwill of
which Mr. Seaton spoke should come from
her!</p>

<p>She and Lady Frederica drove home together;
Sydney full of eagerness for the
post, which would have come while they were
at church.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica laughed, and said Sydney
was “the most childish girl for her age she had
ever known”; but when they reached the
Castle, she fastened a dainty little pearl brooch
into the collar of the girl’s frock, with a
“There, my dear, is a Christmas present for
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Sydney was a good deal touched by this
kindness from one who generally seemed
dissatisfied with her, but still she was undoubtedly
relieved when Lady Frederica told
her that she might take her parcels and letters
to her rooms and amuse herself as she liked till
luncheon. Lady Frederica, it appeared, was
going to rest after the tremendous exertion of
getting up sufficiently early to attend eleven
o’clock service!</p>

<p>Sydney and Miss Osric spent a blissful hour
over the letters and presents. I think Sydney
cried a little over those with the London post-mark,
for Christmas-time with its associations
had made her more homesick than she knew.</p>

<p>They had all written to the absent one, and
there were presents from everybody. No one
had forgotten her, from old nurse down to
Prissie. Sydney and Miss Osric undid parcels
and munched home-made toffee with a noble
disregard for the spoiling of their appetites,
until the luncheon gong sounded, by which
time the morning-room where they were sitting
looked exactly like a Christmas bazaar.</p>

<p>But Sydney had not forgotten her morning’s
resolution, and when lunch was over and Lady
Frederica, exhausted, doubtless, by her unaccustomed
early rising, had fallen asleep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
her chair, Sydney got up and moved softly
from the gold drawing-room, crossed the hall,
and tapped lightly at the door of the library.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said St. Quentin’s voice.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon was with his host, and both
men looked up as she entered. The excitement
of the home letters had brought a flush to
her face, and her eyes were very bright. Sir
Algernon let his cigarette drop from between
his fingers as he looked at her. “By Jove!”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to interrupt you,” said Sydney,
flushing under his cool survey. “I only”—with
an unconsciously appealing glance in the
direction of the sofa—“I only came to give my
Christmas wishes to you, Cousin St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said St. Quentin, holding out his
hand to her. “You’re going for a stroll in the
park, aren’t you, Bridge?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, of course I am,” his friend
answered. “Have a look round at the timber,
eh, Quin? Miss Lisle, I hope you made my
humble apologies to the Vicar for not attending
church this morning. Oh, all right!” in
answer to a rather impatient sound from the
sofa. “I’m off, old man. Ta-ta!”</p>

<p>He lounged out, and Sydney felt relieved by
his absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t like Bridge?” her cousin asked
her quickly.</p>

<p>Sydney was uncompromising in her views at
all times. “Not at all,” she said.</p>

<p>If she had been looking at St. Quentin at
the moment she would have seen an expression
of relief on his face at her answer. But she
was looking round the room, which certainly
was rather untidy.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like the hearth swept, and
these cards put away in their case, and the
papers in a drawer?” she asked her cousin.
“I don’t believe Dickson has been in here
since this morning, has he?”</p>

<p>“No, Bridge and I were talking private
business.”</p>

<p>“Shall I put away the papers, Cousin St.
Quentin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the second drawer of the writing-table,
left hand side. Lock it, please, and give
me the key.”</p>

<p>She obeyed him, then swept up the hearth,
regardless of his “Ring for Dickson!” and
finally sat down in the great brown leather
chair by the fireside.</p>

<p>“Cousin St. Quentin, may I ask you one or
two questions?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Must</em> you do business with Sir Algernon?
I am sure it can’t be very good for you. You
are looking much more ill. I don’t think Dr.
Lorry would like it.”</p>

<p>He smiled a little at her grandmotherly
tone.</p>

<p>“Is it to do with money?” she asked, with
a remembrance of a certain pucker on father’s
brow, which Christmas bills brought with
them.</p>

<p>“Partly; not all. Let’s talk of something
else, instead of boring you with my affairs,”
her cousin said.</p>

<p>“They don’t bore me. Of course I care to
know your bothers!” she declared.</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows and looked at her
in a considering kind of way. “Do you?
I wonder why?” He laughed a little. “Go
ahead and talk to me,” he said. “Tell me
what you’ve done to-day. I suppose you had
letters by the ream from your beloved
Chichesters?”</p>

<p>Sydney reddened, remembering their last
interview upon that subject. Her cousin
seemed to recollect it too.</p>

<p>“Has it ever struck you that you’ll have
a much better time of it when I’m gone?” he
said. “As long as you look pretty and walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
into a room the right way, Aunt Rica won’t
interfere with you much.”</p>

<p>“How can you?” the girl cried, with hot
indignation. “I hate to hear you talk like
that! Why, you’ve been very kind to me—except
about the Chichesters!”</p>

<p>“And that’s a rather big exception, isn’t
it?” St. Quentin said. “You haven’t got
much cause to like me, Sydney.”</p>

<p>Something in the sadness of his tone
appealed to her pity.</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> care about you!” she said. “You
say those horrid things about the Chichesters
just because you don’t understand, that’s all.
Some day, perhaps, you will know that one
<em>couldn’t</em> give up loving people, even if one
tried. But I do care about you, really! I think
you are the very bravest person that I ever
met!”</p>

<p>St. Quentin did not answer for a minute,
and when he spoke, though it was lightly,
his voice was not quite so steady as usual.</p>

<p>“Is it very rude to suggest to a lady,
who is going to reach the advanced age of
eighteen in a few days’ time, that her experience
of life may possibly be limited?” he said.
“My dear child, I regret to say you’re out
in your conception of my character. I am a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
coward. Of course, I hope one is enough of
a man not to make a fuss over the inevitable,
by which I mean the consequences of my
motor-smash. What is, is, and only fools
whine over it. But for all that, I’m a coward.
There, let’s talk of something else!” He
leaned back and closed his eyes. “Tell me
what you like.”</p>

<p>And Sydney told him about Lady Frederica
and her present; about Pauly and the hymn;
and everything else she could think of that
might amuse or interest him.</p>

<p>She told of the knobby parcels they had
taken round the village in the pony-carriage
yesterday, and of the fright of one old woman
when a rolled-up pair of thick stockings had
slipped from Sydney’s over-laden arms, and
gone rolling across the kitchen floor to her
very feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped her merry talk, and
her eyes took a thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” her cousin
asked, looking across at the creamy-gowned
figure in the brown chair.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the cottages,” she
answered. “They are so wretched and so damp,
St. Quentin, and the people told me there
could be no ‘Merry Christmas’ for them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“That meddling parson has been putting
you up to that idea, I suppose!” he said
sharply.</p>

<p>“No, I saw the cottages for myself. Oh, St.
Quentin, can’t <em>something</em> be done?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!”</p>

<p>She looked at him with troubled eyes. “I
expect <em>I</em> cost a good deal of money. Couldn’t
I have fewer frocks and things of that kind?
Or perhaps,” with an effort, “we might sell
Bessie: keeping a horse is so expensive, I’ve
heard father say.”</p>

<p>St. Quentin’s voice was stern as he stopped
her. “Don’t talk of what you do not understand.
I can do nothing for the cottages at
present. If it’s any consolation to you, I will
tell you this—I wish I could. There; talk of
something else, for goodness’ sake!”</p>

<p>She talked on, though feeling little in the
mood for conversation, and was rewarded by
his exclamation of astonishment on learning
the lateness of the hour when Dickson came
in to light the lamp.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve kept you here two mortal hours,
forgetting all about the time; you must be sick
of me! A nice way to make you spend your
Christmas Day! However, you’ve made mine a
bit more cheerful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>As the girl passed his sofa on the way to the
door, he took her hand, saying, “Have you
forgiven me for what I said about the Chichesters
the other day?”</p>

<p>And Sydney, remembering that morning’s
sermon, said “Yes,” with all her heart.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">HUGH’S BATTLE</span></h2>

<p>“What’s the matter, Hugh?”</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester flung the question suddenly
into the deep silence which had fallen on himself
and his son, as they sat together by the study
fire on a cold night shortly after Christmas.</p>

<p>They had done a little talking.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester had said it was a bitter night,
and Hugh had assented. The doctor had remarked
that a fire and a book were wonderfully
soothing after a long day’s work, and Hugh
had owned the fact. The doctor had opined
that if the frost lasted, there would shortly be
skating on the Serpentine. Hugh had agreed
to that as well, but in so absent and spiritless a
manner that his father plainly saw he took no
interest whatever in the skating prospects at
the present moment.</p>

<p>And after these attempts at conversation,
silence had fallen on them, and the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
forgetful of the book upon his knee, closely
scrutinised the young face before him, with its
dark, sad eyes fixed on the glowing fire.</p>

<p>Hugh had been curiously silent ever since
that visit to Donisbro’, his father thought to
himself.</p>

<p>And yet, how pleased he had been at being
singled out by Sir Anthony to go with him!
And he had come back, having done everything
required of him successfully enough, so far as
his father could make out. But he had been
very uncommunicative over his adventures in
the quaint cathedral city.</p>

<p>It had been left for Sir Anthony to catch the
doctor on the staircase of Blue-friars’ Hospital,
and ask him if “the boy had remembered to
tell his father that Sir Anthony had said he
was a credit to the medical profession.” Hugh
had not even mentioned the great man’s rare
commendation.</p>

<p>What had he said about that visit? The
doctor went over in his own mind the rather
bald account which the united efforts of the
family had with difficulty pumped out.</p>

<p>Yes, Hugh had seen Sydney. She was
looking very well—this in answer to a question
from Mrs. Chichester. She had sent her love
to them all. There hadn’t been much time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Lady Frederica had been in a great hurry to
be off. There was a man with Sydney, a Sir
Algernon Bridge. Was he nice?—a query
from Dolly. Well, Hugh hadn’t asked him,
but considered that he looked a sneery brute,
although not wishing to say anything against
him. Yes, he had seen Sydney again: she
was up the church tower with the Vicar, who
seemed a good sort, and his boy, a jolly little
chap. The incident of Pauly’s rescue somehow
failed to transpire at all. No, he hadn’t
been to the Castle—this in reply to some excited
inquiries on the subject of merry-go-rounds
from Fred and Prissie. He had lunched with
the Vicar, who had said that Sydney was interested
in the cottages, and took the people soup
and things. Hugh didn’t think anything much
else had happened. Oh, how was Sydney
dressed? He didn’t know—something blue,
he thought. No, something red, and fur—a lot
of fur. Was she looking pretty? How should
he know?</p>

<p>Hugh had become a little irritable at this
point, his father recollected: a circumstance
almost as unprecedented as his gravity and
silence.</p>

<p>What was wrong with the boy?</p>

<p>The keen-eyed doctor noted his dejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
attitude, and the wistfulness of the gaze turned
so persistently upon the fire. If Hugh was
reading his future there it certainly was not
a bright one.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester watched in silence for full
another ten minutes, then repeated his question
with a hand upon the young man’s knee.</p>

<p>“Hugh, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Hugh started and flushed hotly, becoming
conscious of his father’s scrutiny. Then he
pulled himself together, and said, with a lightness
of tone which was rather obviously
assumed for convenience’ sake at the moment,
“Oh, nothing, sir. I was thinking, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Then thinking doesn’t seem to agree with
you, my boy,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>Hugh raised himself in his chair, and bent
forward with some eagerness.</p>

<p>“Father, do you mind if I go out to my
chum, Haviland, in New Zealand? He wants
a partner and—and—I want to go.”</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester considered.</p>

<p>“You have a very good position at the
Blue-friars, Hugh,” he said at length. “Do
you want to throw that up?”</p>

<p>Hugh rose, and walked about the room a
little restlessly.</p>

<p>“I know it seems foolish,” he said, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I’ve a fancy for trying new ground, and
Haviland is beginning to establish a practice,
and——”</p>

<p>“And you want to get as far away from
England as you can?” his father quietly
suggested.</p>

<p>Hugh’s back was turned towards him and he
did not answer. The doctor went to his son,
and put an arm through his.</p>

<p>“Sit down, my boy, and tell me all about
it,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you know,” cried poor Hugh.
“I always cared specially for Sydney, more
than I did for Mildred, or Dolly, or the rest.
I didn’t know why—just I did. And then
she got carried off by this Lord St. Quentin,
and you bet they mean to marry her to that
idiot with a drawl and eye-glass, who was with
her at Donisbro’. She was quite different
on the church tower, but I saw that she minded,
bless her! Of course I tried to make her
think I was all right. I couldn’t have her
worry herself thinking I was angry at the way
she treated me. <em>She</em> wasn’t to blame, anyway.
I think she thought I was—all right; but I
<em>must</em> get right away from England and forget
it all. There’s no other way.”</p>

<p>“There is,” said the doctor. “Look here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
my boy. This is a hard thing for you, I know;
but running away from a trouble is not the best
way of getting over it, by any means. I’m not
going to talk to you about the help you are
at home with the younger boys, nor what
it will mean to your mother and myself if
we have to give up our eldest son. You
are a man, making your own way in the world,
and you have a perfect right to judge for
yourself. More, if you find the struggle too
hard for you to face, and face cheerfully, I
counsel you to go abroad, and start a new life
there. If at the end of a week you still want
to go to New Zealand, I’m not the man to put
difficulties in your path. My poor boy, I wish
I could say to you, as they do in novels,
‘Make yourself worthy of our little girl’s
acceptance, and then Love will win.’ I can’t
say that, but I can tell you something finer
still: Make yourself worthy to love her, and
some day you’ll thank God, Who gave you
the love, though not its earthly fulfilment.
I wouldn’t wish you not to love the child, for
love is God’s best gift. Only take it as God
meant His gifts to be taken—thankfully, and
not asking more than He is pleased to offer.
Do you remember our little girl going wild
over that copy of ‘Dorothy Osborne’s Letters,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
which I got for her last birthday, and reading
bits aloud whenever she could get a listener?
Dorothy Osborne’s lover called himself her
‘servant.’ There, that’s something for you to
think of, eh, my boy? True love wants to
serve humbly and not grasp.”</p>

<p>“If I thought she’d ever need my service——”
Hugh began impulsively.</p>

<p>“Who knows that she may not?” said the
doctor with a smile. “But decide nothing in a
hurry, dear boy; and go to bed now, for it’s
after one.”</p>

<p>“Just one thing more?” Hugh said,
his hand on the door. “You—you would
rather that I stuck to the Blue-friars, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“I would rather you did what seems best to
you when you have thought it over for a
week,” the doctor said. “Good-night, and God
bless you, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, father,” Hugh said, and so
went thoughtfully upstairs to his attic bedroom,
leaving the doctor to sit down again over the
dying fire, and think sadly of his boy’s trouble,
this cloud which seemed so little likely to
roll away.</p>

<p>That week was a very long one to the
doctor and to Hugh’s mother; the others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in ignorance of the decision in course of
making.</p>

<p>Hugh was very quiet all the time, doing his
work day by day, and when at home noting all
that went on with a new observance.</p>

<p>But when the appointed day arrived, he
seemed suddenly to have cast off his
troubles.</p>

<p>His father and mother exchanged glances as
he romped with Fred and Prissie before they
went to bed, and seemed in all ways to have
returned to his old cheery self.</p>

<p>“What shall we do without him?” was the
thought in both their minds, for they could not
doubt his high spirits to be caused by the
thought of beginning on a new life with the
old troubles left behind him.</p>

<p>The evening came to an end at last, and
all the juniors except Hugh and Mildred had
retired to bed.</p>

<p>Hugh fidgeted with the lamp for a minute,
and then threw himself down upon the
rug, his head upon his mother’s knee. She
smoothed his hair with loving fingers. “Well,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wrote to Haviland this morning
and declined his offer,” Hugh answered; “told
him I had too good a berth at the Blue-friars to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
throw it up, but ‘thanked him kindly all the
same,’ and——”</p>

<p>“You’re going to stay, my boy?” his father
cried, in a voice that was not quite so firm
as usual.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Hugh said steadily, “I’m going
to stay.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">AT THE DEANERY</span></h2>

<p>“This <em>is</em> delightful!” Sydney cried, as she
sat down beside the bright fire in the pretty
bedroom near Katharine’s, which had been
allotted to her at the Deanery. “It is quite
too lovely of you to ask me, and it is quite
too lovely of them to let me come! I never
thought I should be allowed to, and Lady
Frederica said ‘No’ at first, and I mustn’t
go visiting because of not being ‘out’; but
St. Quentin stood by me, and said everyone
had holidays at Christmas-time, and I <em>should</em>
go if I wanted. You can guess how much
I did want; even now it seems too good to
be true!”</p>

<p>“Well, I am very pleased to have you,
dear,” Katharine said, smiling across at the
girl, “though I wish it were for longer than
two days. There is so much I want to hear.
I miss the calisthenic class now that there are
Christmas holidays for everybody. How did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you spend Christmas, and how is your
cousin?”</p>

<p>“I hoped he might be better because he
didn’t seem getting worse,” Sydney said a
little sadly; “but Dr. Lorry doesn’t seem to
think so. He says St. Quentin must get
weaker, and that it is only his splendid constitution
makes him fight so long.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes in the
pretty room.</p>

<p>“Well, you haven’t told me yet how you
spent Christmas?” Katharine asked, rousing
herself with an effort.</p>

<p>“Sir Algernon was with us——” began
Sydney, but was interrupted.</p>

<p>“Whom did you say?”</p>

<p>“Sir Algernon Bridge; he is a friend, I
think, of Cousin St. Quentin’s.”</p>

<p>“And he is at the Castle now? Sydney
dear, promise me, don’t have more to do than
you can help with that man!”</p>

<p>Sydney hardly knew the quiet girl; her
eyes were flashing, and there was a bright
colour in her face.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear him!” she said; “and I don’t
see a great deal of him—at least, I did not,
but since Christmas Day he has been more
with Miss Osric and me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have as little to do with him as possible,”
said Katharine earnestly. “Your cousin ought
not to allow him to be with you. I will tell
you something about him, Sydney, and then
you will see what I mean.”</p>

<p>She played nervously for a minute with the
fire-screen on her knee, then began, speaking
low.</p>

<p>“It is a story about a girl, not very much
older than you are, whose life was spoiled
because she listened to him. This girl cared
for a man very much indeed, and he cared
for her; only she would not be engaged,
because the man did not care enough to
give up his faults and extravagances for her
sake.</p>

<p>“But she did care, more than you can
understand! Sir Algernon knew her, and one
day he asked her to marry him. She said
‘No,’ of course, and he was angry, for he
guessed about this other man.... Then—I
don’t know how to tell you, Sydney dear—a
very dreadful thing happened.... The man
she cared for was suspected of doing an
exceedingly dishonourable action. The girl
was away from home when this—thing—happened,
so she knew nothing till she came
back. The first thing she did when she heard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was to snatch up pen and paper and write a
letter to the man she loved, telling him that
she did not believe a word against him, and
only cared for him more if possible than she
had done before....”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind of thing you would have
done!” cried Sydney; “please go on. Wasn’t
the man very, very pleased to get the letter?”</p>

<p>Katharine knelt down to stir the fire, although
it did not stand in any need of stirring.</p>

<p>“She never sent the letter, Sydney dear....
She had just addressed it when Sir Algernon
came in. He told her he had come to ask for
her advice. He had had a letter, seeming
to come from some poor woman in distress, he
said, and asking for his help. Knowing the
girl was interested in such cases, he asked her
if she would read the letter, and tell him if she
thought the case one suited for his help....</p>

<p>“Of course the girl said ‘Yes,’ and he gave her
a dirty envelope, looking very carefully inside
it first, she saw, though she hardly noticed
at the time. He told her, as he gave it to her,
that she would need to read it very carefully
and slowly, as the woman was exceedingly
illiterate.... It was written in a cramped, odd
hand-writing, but it was quite correctly spelled.
When the girl had read about half, she saw that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the letter was from no poor woman ... but
from the man she cared for, and oh, Sydney!
it seemed to show beyond possibility of doubt
that he was guilty of this dreadful meanness in
which the girl had refused to believe.... Sir
Algernon pretended to be dreadfully distressed
when the girl gave him back the half-read
letter, and said he must have put this by
mistake into the wrong envelope, and he never
should forgive himself, for he had promised to
suppress the man’s letter, because they had
been friends. And the girl thought he was
very generous!</p>

<p>“When he had gone, she put that loving
letter in the fire, and wrote another to the man
she loved, not mentioning the letter she had
seen, but merely saying that she never wished
to see or hear of him again! I think, even
then, she half hoped for some explanation from
him, but none came. She was very miserable,
Sydney.”</p>

<p>“I think she deserved to be!” Sydney cried.
“Why, if she really cared for the man, how
could she help believing in him?—all the more
if things went against him. I don’t believe she
loved him!”</p>

<p>She wondered as she spoke why her friend
looked so white, even in the dancing fire-light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“She did care, but not enough,” said
Katharine Morrell, and there was a pause.</p>

<p>“Did she ever get to know?” asked Sydney,
after waiting in vain for her to go on.</p>

<p>“Yes, by-and-by, when she had thought
about it more, and grown older, and heard
more about Sir Algernon. She felt sure then
that the man she loved was innocent of that
dishonourable action: that he could not have
been guilty of it. And she guessed that Sir
Algernon had given her the note to read on
purpose that she might act as she did. He
had set a trap for her, but she would not have
fallen into it if she had only had more love
and trust and patience.”</p>

<p>“When she knew, did she write to the
man and tell him?” Sydney questioned
earnestly.</p>

<p>“No, dear, she couldn’t. The man had
given up caring, for one thing, you see. No,
that is the end of the story! I am afraid
there is no ‘lived happily ever after’ to finish
this. I only tell you of it, because I want
you to be warned against Sir Algernon.”
There was a silence in the pretty room; then
Katharine rose a little wearily. “Good-night,
dear; don’t be worried by that girl’s story,
which is all past and gone. Only be warned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
as I wish she had been warned, against Sir
Algernon.”</p>

<p>Sydney thought a good deal of Katharine’s
words during the busy, happy day which
followed, when she seemed plunged back for
the time being into the merry Sydney of home.
There was a Christmas-tree at the Hospital,
and Sydney went with her friend and helped
her take round the presents to the patients,
and made the acquaintance of Miss Osric’s
father, and enjoyed herself exceedingly.</p>

<p>And next day Miss Morrell entertained all
the women of her working-party at the
Deanery, and Sydney and the little cousin
Sylvia helped to wait on them at tea and
amuse them. Sydney quite made friends with
a gentle-faced woman, whose smile made her
think a little bit of mother’s, and sat beside
her talking to her for a great part of the
evening.</p>

<p>“Yes, this sewing-party it were Miss
Morrell’s plan, miss,” said Mrs. Carter, “and
many’s the times as we’ve blessed her for it.
You see, miss, most of us here went out to
service that early as we hadn’t time to learn
more sewing than the roughest kind, and
patterns and things of that kind don’t come
much in the way of poor folk. Well, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Morrell she knew that, so she went and
learned herself how to make gowns and underwear
and children’s clothes and such-like, and
then she has a working-party once a week
for to learn us. And we sits in her own
morning-room, with all her pretty things about,
for all the world as if we was ladies, and she
has the rolls of stuff down cheaper from the
big shops than we can buy it, and lets us
pay as we can. And she cuts out the things
for us, and learns us all about the making
of ’em, talking or reading to us in between,
very sweet. And by-and-by we has tea;
all served very dainty, with Mr. Tomkins, the
footman, handing round as polite as anything.
I can tell you, miss, it makes a real rest for
us to sit and work in that there pretty room,
and it makes a sight of difference, too, to
the way that we dress the children. Why,
mine was turned out as neat and nice as
anything, though I say it as shouldn’t, all
through last winter, and at half the cost of
dressing ’em in them shop-made things, as
comes all to pieces before you know where
to have ’em. Miss Morrell, she don’t hardly
let nothing interfere with our sewing-party.
She’s a real young lady, she is, bless her!”</p>

<p>“Katharine,” said Sydney that evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
when the guests had departed, “I wish I
were half as good as you are. Don’t you
sometimes find that work-party a great bother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course it is a little inconvenient
sometimes,” she said; “but the women are
so nice and so grateful, and one is so glad to
have something one can do for them oneself.
Papa is always very good in letting me relieve
special cases of trouble, but it is <em>his</em> money,
not mine, you see. The best kind of giving
is what one gives oneself, don’t you think?
And most of us can give our time and trouble,
even if we can give nothing else.”</p>

<p>Sydney took these words home with her
next day, when reluctantly she had bade
good-bye to Katharine, and been put by the
silver-haired Dean into the charge of Miss
Osric, who had come to Donisbro’ to fetch
her.</p>

<p>“Most of us can give our time and trouble,
even if we can give nothing else.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">LITTLE THINGS</span></h2>

<p>“Mrs. Sawyer says she will be proud and
pleased to let us use her kitchen for nothing,”
Sydney said, “but we must pay her for the
fire. She doesn’t have one in the afternoons,
as a rule. How much does a fire cost, Miss
Osric?”</p>

<p>The girl was puckering her brows over a
business-like account book open on the table
before her. Miss Osric stood opposite, driving
a great pair of squeaking scissors through a
double fold of flannel.</p>

<p>“We should want it for about two hours,
shouldn’t we?” she said, in answer to Sydney’s
question. “It would probably cost about
sevenpence a time, but that depends upon
the sort of coal Mrs. Sawyer has, and how
big a fire you mean to keep.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen pence—one and twopence a
week,” Sydney said, noting the fact down in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
account book. “And then there is the tea,”
she went on. “I wonder how much that
will cost? And I don’t suppose the people
will be able to pay much at first towards the
stuff they use. They are so poor, and one
wants to help them.”</p>

<p>“Let them pay something towards it,
Sydney,” said Miss Osric; “don’t make paupers
of them—that is a mistake. Say they pay
half expenses.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps,” the girl said. “How many
petticoats will that roll of flannel make, do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Not very many, and flannel is so dreadfully
expensive; you will have to use
flannelette, I think.”</p>

<p>“No, it <em>must</em> be flannel,” said Sydney.
“I asked Dr. Lorry, and he said rheumatic
people should wear flannel. And you know
how dreadfully rheumatic they are here.”</p>

<p>There was another anxious calculation of
accounts, which lasted until Sydney, pulling
out the lovely little gold watch which had been
her cousin’s present to her on her birthday,
a day or two ago, found that it was time to
dress for going out with Lady Frederica.</p>

<p>The girl had lost no time on her return
from that Christmas visit at the Deanery in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
starting on her plans. Miss Osric proved a
willing helper, and Lady Frederica, approached
judiciously at a favourable moment on the
subject, had raised no objection to the projected
working-party. “Oh, yes, amuse yourself
as you like, my dear,” she said, “as
long as you don’t go about alone, or damage
your complexion.”</p>

<p>And Sydney had joyfully availed herself
of the permission to drive in to Dacreshaw
and order such materials as Miss Osric thought
would be most useful to the women of the
village.</p>

<p>Sydney had no difficulty in persuading them
to come, though at first they found it hard
to believe that anybody from the Castle was
really going to take an interest in their
troubles. But Sydney’s bright face, as she
brought soup or invalid fare of some kind,
coaxed out of Mrs. Fewkes, the Castle cook,
had grown familiar already in cottages where
there was illness, and they were beginning
slowly to realize that the future Lady St.
Quentin held very different views from her
cousin on the subject of the tenantry who
would be hers some day.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a good time coming when that
little lady’s mistress here,” they said to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
another, and welcomed the idea of the working-parties
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All was to be as far as possible on the lines
of Miss Morrell’s, and Sydney set about buying
just the same materials as those used by her
friend. But flannel, long-cloth, wool, and serge
cost money, and she found the small remains of
her quarter’s allowance quite inadequate. Her
extensive Christmas purchases had reduced the
amount, which had seemed at first so inexhaustible,
to a very small remnant by the time
she set about the shopping for this new scheme.
Hence the anxious discussion with Miss Osric
over ways and means.</p>

<p>It never struck Sydney for one moment to
apply for help to her cousin. He had said
he could do nothing for the cottages; clearly
what was done must be done by herself
alone.</p>

<p>How did girls in story-books make money?
She cast her mind over those that she had read.
The heroines of fiction seemed to have a
habit of painting the picture of the year, or
writing a novel that took all London by storm.
Sydney felt quite certain of her inability to
follow either example.</p>

<p>Sometimes they were adopted by wealthy
old gentlemen or ladies in search of deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
heirs, but Sydney thought she had had enough
of changing her home! Sometimes they discovered
treasure in places where even newspaper
editors would never think of hiding
it. “It would be a great deal easier if some
of them did little things,” poor Sydney
thought.</p>

<p>No solution of the problem had occurred
to her by the date fixed for the first working-party;
when a plain but plentiful tea was
spread on Mrs. Sawyer’s dresser, and a somewhat
meagre pile of unmade flannel petticoats
adorned the table.</p>

<p>Sydney received her guests a little shyly, but
with so much real pleasure in her face that
they had no doubt of their welcome. She and
Miss Osric helped them to take off their shawls
and jackets, which Mrs. Sawyer, a sickly
looking woman in a very clean apron, put away
in the ill-drained and ill-ventilated cupboard
which she called the back kitchen.</p>

<p>Then came the distribution of garments to
be made for themselves or their children by
the workers, and here poor Sydney found the
demand for flannel petticoats far exceeding her
supply.</p>

<p>The women were exceedingly polite about it,
and assured her that it did not matter, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the girl felt she would have given anything to
have had enough for their wants.</p>

<p>Needlework, an accomplishment Lady
Frederica had not asked for, was one that
Sydney had learnt “at the doctor’s,” and Miss
Osric had had plenty of experience in the
cutting-out line in old days at her father’s
Vicarage. So everything went smoothly:
conversation was much easier than Sydney had
expected it to be, and the women seemed to
thoroughly enjoy their tea. All would have
been quite delightful to the girl, even though
the ill-ventilated kitchen was very close with so
many people sitting in it, and the damp of the
uneven stone floor made her feet, in their
delicate Parisian boots, extremely cold, if it had
not been for the haunting thought of how she
should procure the money necessary for the
carrying on of her scheme.</p>

<p>“Only the sixth of January,” she said
dismally to Miss Osric, as the two hurried
down the village to the second working-party.
“Only the sixth of January to-day, and
Quarter Day isn’t till the twenty-fifth of March.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I wish I could help you,” said Miss Osric,
“but you know I must send all I can spare to
them at home. It costs so much to send my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
brother Jack to Oxford, and there are Dorothy
and Hilda who ought to go to school as soon
as we can manage it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried Sydney. “I wouldn’t
have you help in the money way for anything;
just think what an amount of the other kind
of help you are giving!” And they went into
Mrs. Sawyer’s cottage and discussed the money
question no more.</p>

<p>An observation of Lady Frederica’s next
day gave Sydney the idea for which she was
longing. Sir Algernon, who had been in town
since Sydney’s return from the Deanery, came
back that morning, and announced at luncheon
that the Castle clocks were all behind London
time. Sydney, eager to establish the perfections
of her new watch, pulled it out triumphantly
to inform the company that in that case her
treasure was correct, for St. Quentin had
declared it only that morning to be rather
fast.</p>

<p>Its beauty caught Lady Frederica’s eye.
“Dear me, child!” she said, “is that the
watch St. Quentin gave you on your birthday.
What a little beauty! But how extravagant of
him, when he was speaking to me quite
seriously only a day or two ago about retrenching!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor old chap, is he feeling pinched?” Sir
Algernon said lightly. “There are moments,
Lady Frederica, when I bless the luck that
gave me a title unencumbered by a property
to keep going. May I see the watch, Miss
Lisle?” He spoke with a new inflection in
his voice which did not escape Lady Frederica.
“Yes, it <em>is</em> a beauty and no mistake. I expect
they rooked old Quin something heavy for
that.”</p>

<p>“It was <em>very</em> kind of St. Quentin,” Sydney
said, and Sir Algernon murmured, “Lucky
beggar!” in a tone the girl found hard to
understand.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on other topics, but
Sydney did not forget it, and, after much
screwing up of her courage, went into the
library a day or two later, having previously
watched Sir Algernon off on a ride.</p>

<p>“St. Quentin,” she said, feeling very much
astounded by her own daring, “I’ve come to
ask a favour of you; and please—<em>please</em> be
very kind, and don’t ask any questions or be
angry when you hear what I want. Do say
you’ll be kind!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a nice modest request, anyhow,”
her cousin said, smiling a little. “What
awful things have you been doing? Oh, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
course, I’m not to ask. If you were a
boy I should guess you to be in a scrape,
but girls keep clear of those things, don’t
they?”</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh,” said Sydney; “at least, I
would rather you laughed than were angry.
St. Quentin, <em>please</em> don’t think me horribly ungrateful,
but may—can I change the watch you
gave me on my birthday?”</p>

<p>“What, don’t you like it?” said St. Quentin
slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do! I do!” she cried; “but, please,
you <em>said</em> you wouldn’t ask questions, and I
want to change it!”</p>

<p>“Who will do the job for you?” her cousin
said. “I ordered the watch from Oliver’s in
Donisbro’, if you wish to know; but mind, I
won’t have you poking about changing things
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Miss Osric said she knew her father
would change it for me, if you gave permission,”
said Sydney. “St. Quentin, I can see
you are vexed.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” he said, a little bit impatiently,
“but I should like to get at the
bottom of this, Sydney. Can’t you tell me
straight out what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t,” she assured him, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
nothing is wrong really, on my honour! Miss
Osric knows all about it, and she is <em>ever</em> so
wise and experienced!”</p>

<p>“A Methuselah of twenty-three years, isn’t
she?” St. Quentin said, smiling despite his
vexation. “Well, Sydney, I suppose I must
let you go your own way. Put the matter
into the hands of your mentor’s father, and
have nothing personally to do with it, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>If it cost Sydney a pang to part with her
treasured watch, and it did undoubtedly, she
was more than repaid by the look upon the
women’s faces as they saw the noble pile of
flannel garments laid out for their benefit.
Mr. Osric had done his part well, and obtained
for Sydney very nearly the full value of the
watch, after some argument with Mr. Oliver,
who declared that he “never took back an
article when sold.”</p>

<p>He was, however, speedily rewarded for
yielding by a gentleman with light blue eyes
and a monocle, who had been turning over
scarf pins at the other end of the shop during
Mr. Osric’s transaction.</p>

<p>This gentleman came closer to Oliver, when
Mr. Osric had gone out, and requested to be
allowed to examine the little watch the clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had left behind him. After a brief but
careful examination he asked the price, and
bought it, leaving Mr. Oliver, who knew Sir
Algernon Bridge well enough by sight, to
shrewdly surmise that a “single gentleman
who bought a lady’s watch must shortly be
intending to be married.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">A PROPOSAL</span></h2>

<p>A sleety rain was falling, but, despite the cold,
St. Quentin’s couch was drawn up close beneath
the mullioned windows of the library,
from which he could look out upon the green
expanse of Park and the mighty trees, which
had seen generations of his family reign their
reign at the great old Castle, and die.</p>

<p>The present owner’s face was sad enough,
as he gazed out on the splendid prospect,
beautiful even in the bareness of winter and
the dreariness of rain.</p>

<p>At his elbow lay an invalid writing-desk
and a sheet of paper, on which the words
were written: “Dear Fane—Cut the timber
from....” He had gone no further, though
he had started that letter to his agent when
Sir Algernon had left him an hour ago.</p>

<p>A sentence kept rising up before him whenever
he took up his pen to write, a sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
which, though spoken more than five years
ago, was fresh as though he heard it yesterday.</p>

<p>“<em>We’ve never let the timber go, my boy.</em>”</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered that his father had
paid his, St. Quentin’s, debts by care and
economy, but without sacrificing any of the
splendid trees, which were the pride of the
county. “<em>We’ve never let the timber go, my
boy.</em>” He turned his head with an impatient
sigh and flung the paper down again, staring
from the rain-washed window gloomily.</p>

<p>As he looked aimlessly enough, something
crossed his line of vision that made him start
into a sudden interest and life.</p>

<p>Two ladies, wrapped in waterproofs and
wrestling with refractory umbrellas, passed
beneath his window, carrying a large basket.
In spite of sleet and rain they walked fast
as though in a hurry, and quickly disappeared
amid the trees, though not before Sydney’s
cousin had recognised the scarlet tam-o’-shanter
and long tail of refractory brown hair, blown
every way.</p>

<p>“What on earth can the child be thinking
of to go out on such an afternoon!” St.
Quentin said to himself, and he rang sharply
for Dickson.</p>

<p>“Where has Miss Lisle gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will enquire, my lord.”</p>

<p>The servant vanished, but returned in a few
minutes with the information—“Miss Lisle and
Miss Osric have gone down to the village,
my lord. Miss Lisle holds a sewing meeting
for the village women on two afternoons a week,
my lord.”</p>

<p>St. Quentin considered this information,
then enquired, “Is Lady Frederica in?”</p>

<p>“I will enquire, my lord.”</p>

<p>“If she is disengaged, ask if she could spare
me five minutes.”</p>

<p>Dickson withdrew, and shortly afterwards
Lady Frederica tripped in, looking as though
she considered somebody very much to blame
for the dreariness of the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Aunt Rica,” said her nephew, “did you
know of this preposterous idea of Sydney’s—teaching
old women to sew or something, on a
beastly afternoon like this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she asked my leave to do something
of the kind,” Lady Frederica answered,
with a yawn. “She said something, I remember,
about the people being poor and miserable
here, and wanting to help them, and you
having told her you could do nothing. All she
wanted was to do something or another for the
women—I forget what—but I know it did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
seem to me likely to damage her figure or
complexion. Oh, I see, you don’t like it, but
girls <em>will</em> amuse themselves, St. Quentin, and
slumming is quite <em>the</em> last thing, you know!”</p>

<p>A remembrance of the girl’s earnest face
as they talked on Christmas Day came over
her cousin. How keen the child had been
over the rebuilding of those cottages, which
were a disgrace to him, he knew, and not the
only blot by a long way on the great St.
Quentin estates. So that was why she wished
to change her watch. Why on earth couldn’t he
have seen, and given her the money, instead of
leaving her to sacrifice her own little treasures
for the benefit of his tenants! Having failed
to persuade him to do his duty by them, she
was trying, with the little means she had, to
do it for him. He crushed that unfinished
letter to his agent impatiently between his
fingers. The order he had been about to give
him became if possible more distasteful than it
had been before. How <em>could</em> he cut off all
chance of doing something for his wretched
tenants! And yet—and yet—what else was
left for him to do but write?</p>

<p>“Well, St. Quentin, if you don’t want me
any more I’ll go back to my novel,” Lady
Frederica said with another yawn. “You’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
most depressing company, my dear boy;
almost as depressing as the weather!”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully for coming,” he said
absently. She turned to leave him; as she
did so her eye fell upon the crumpled paper
on the floor.</p>

<p>“St. Quentin,” she cried sharply, “you’re
<em>not</em> telling Mr. Fane to cut down timber,
are you? Gracious, what would your poor
dear father have said!”</p>

<p>“What I feel,” he said bitterly, “that it’s
a very good thing my reign is near its
end.... Don’t stay if you’d rather not, Aunt
Rica.”</p>

<p>She was by no means unwilling to leave
him for the more cheerful company of a novel
in her own private sitting-room, where the
fire was bright and the chairs very comfortable.
Left once more to himself, he snatched up
a pen, took a fresh sheet of paper, and began
again, “Dear Fane”; then paused.</p>

<p>Sydney’s words on Christmas Day kept
rising up before him, instead of those which
he meant to write.</p>

<p>“<em>Can you do nothing for the cottages?</em>”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” he said half aloud; “and yet—she
thought me brave!”</p>

<p>His letter had progressed no further when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Dickson came in an hour later, as the short
winter’s afternoon drew towards its close.
With an exclamation at the cold, the man
wheeled his master’s couch to the fire, which
he stirred noiselessly into a blaze, brought him
some tea, and lit his reading-lamp.</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle in yet?” asked St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“I will enquire, my lord.” This was
Dickson’s almost invariable answer.</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle has not yet returned, my lord,”
he informed St. Quentin after a voyage in
search of her.</p>

<p>“Ask her to come to me when she does.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord.” Dickson closed the door
softly, and St. Quentin was left alone. He
made no attempt to go on with his letter,
but stared idly in the fire, listening intently.
In about ten minutes the door opened and Sir
Algernon strolled in.</p>

<p>“You!” said St. Quentin, in a tone which
was not expressive of the keenest pleasure.</p>

<p>“Yes, I, old man. I want to talk to you.
By the way, have you sent that note to Fane
about the timber?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t?”</p>

<p>“No; the truth is, Bridge, I’m getting
rather sick of this blackmailing business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are?” Sir Algernon surveyed the
weary, impatient face in silence for a minute.
“I wonder if you’d like to try another tack,”
he suggested softly. “I’ve had a good deal
of cash out of you one way and another, and
now you’re—er—er——”</p>

<p>“Dying,” his host supplied the word.</p>

<p>“Well, going to send in your checks some
time pretty soon, I suppose?” Sir Algernon
amended. “Look here, I know the estate’s
heavily encumbered and all that, but I’m not
a mercenary man, and the girl’s pretty——”</p>

<p>“Of whom are you speaking?”</p>

<p>“Why, Sydney.”</p>

<p>“Kindly leave her name alone: we’re not
talking of her.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we? You’re a bit out, old chap.
What I have to say <em>does</em> concern her, as it
happens. What do you say to this, Quin?
I’ll give my word not to squeeze you further,
and, what’s more, I’ll burn a certain letter that
we know of here—before your eyes—if you’ll
swear to make a match between that little girl
and me. You won’t have opposition to
contend with, I imagine. She’s too much
of a child to have any violent fancies elsewhere,
especially since you and Lady
Frederica between you choked off the chemist’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
assistant. I’d have made running with a bit
myself this last fortnight, only she’s always
about in cottages and accompanied by the
governess. The combination is a little too
much for me to swallow, specially when the
cottages are <em>yours</em>, my dear chap. So I’ll
leave you to do the courting for me, since
she evidently looks on you <i lang="la">in loco parentis</i>.
Eh, if she knew a little more about you she
wouldn’t be so keen to pin her faith upon
you, would she?”</p>

<p>“Have you any more to say?” enquired
St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“No—I think that’s about all. You won’t
be altogether sorry to save your timber, eh,
Quin?”</p>

<p>“Not on your terms, thank you, Bridge.”</p>

<p>“Eh, what? Oh! you don’t believe I have
the letter; there it is.”</p>

<p>He pulled out two or three envelopes from
a pocket-book. “That’s it,” he said, “inside
that thumbed grey envelope; the other is
the letter that you wrote me before settling
to pay up—talking a lot of high faluting about
expecting me to believe your innocence for
the sake of auld lang syne, etc., as if I should
be such a fool!”</p>

<p>“Destroy that letter, anyhow,” St. Quentin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
said, his thin hands clenching. “It’s a bit
of a mockery to keep it now. I still believed
in you more or less when I wrote
it, you see.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon laughed easily. “You were
always a bit of a fool, Quin, from Eton days
onwards. As you say, I may as well get
rid of this precious production of yours.
There’s not much sentiment left nowadays
about our intercourse with one another, is
there? and I’ve nearly muddled it with the
jockey’s before now. Here goes!—Stop, let
me just make sure I’ve got the right one; yes,
that’s it, the cream-coloured envelope with
‘Re Quin’ on the back. Aren’t I a model
man of business, eh? There goes your letter
to me into the flames, old chap, and yours
to Duncombe back into my pocket-book until
you choose to have it follow suit!”</p>

<p>“I don’t choose.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I reject most absolutely your proposal,
thank you. I’ve been a fool and worse, but
I’m not quite the cad that comes to. I’d
sooner see her marry that young Chichester!”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon’s face wore no very amiable
expression. “Is that your final answer?” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“You <em>don’t</em> mean to help me marry
Sydney?”</p>

<p>“No, and what’s more, I don’t intend to
have you in the Castle any longer. You’re not
fit to associate with a girl like that. The
Chichesters have brought her up the right
way, anyhow, and I don’t intend to have you
with her any longer. You must go—and—how
much do you ask for destroying Duncombe’s
letter, for good and all? I won’t have the
child blackmailed when I’m gone. You must
destroy the letter in my sight this time. How
much payment do you want to do what any
decent chap would have done long ago?”</p>

<p>An ugly look was on the handsome face
before him. “You’ll have to pay this time,
my boy,” Sir Algernon said slowly; “well,
rather heavily.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon, without moving from his
lounging posture in the arm-chair, named
a sum which made St. Quentin start with
indignation.</p>

<p>“You are well aware I can’t pay that, or
half it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t, then! I daresay Miss Lisle
will be a little less stingy, when she comes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
age, and I enquire if she would like the letter
published.”</p>

<p>St. Quentin’s hands clenched over one
another.</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a fool, old chap,” his companion
said, rising and coming close to him.
“I don’t really want to be hard upon you.
Give me your word you’ll manage the match,
and I’ll destroy the letter on the spot, and,
what’s more, turn over a new leaf as well.
You needn’t be afraid she won’t be happy—I’ll
reform when I marry that little girl.”</p>

<p>“Have done with Sydney, please. I’d
sooner see her dead than married to you!”</p>

<p>“Pay up, then,” sneered Sir Algernon.</p>

<p>“<em>Can you do nothing for the cottages?</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>We’ve never let the timber go, my boy.</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Can you do nothing for the cottages?</em>”</p>

<p>Without answering Sir Algernon, St. Quentin
seized pen and paper, and began again—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Fane</span>—</p>

<p>“Cut the timber from....”</p>

</div>

<p>The knock at the door was unheard by
both, and neither noticed Sydney’s entrance.</p>

<p>She had changed her wet clothes, but her
hair hung straight and damp about her face.
The face itself was bright with exercise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
looked a strange contrast to the faces of the
two men in the lamp-lit library.</p>

<p>“You sent for me?” she said, going straight
up to her cousin.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, but it doesn’t matter now,” he
said. “Go back to Miss Osric.”</p>

<p>She looked at him. “You are very
tired, St. Quentin! Let me write that letter
for you.”</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon the desk. “You
ought not to be bothered with letters when you
are so tired, and,” with a reproachful glance
at Sir Algernon, “I am <em>sure</em> that you ought
not to talk business any longer.”</p>

<p>“It’s not the talking which has tired him,
Miss Lisle,” said Sir Algernon; “it’s the
thought of something rather disagreeable he
must do, unless you care to save him
from it!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Bridge!” said St.
Quentin, but Sydney had already made a quick
step towards Sir Algernon.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, please, what I can
do to save my cousin’s trouble?” she said
simply. “I would do anything I could for
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="400" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“‘I do not believe one word you say against my cousin!’”</p>
<p class="caption-r">(<a href="#Page_195">Page 195</a>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sydney!” cried St. Quentin hoarsely, but
Sir Algernon had sprung forward and caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the girl’s hands in his. “Sydney! would you?
Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>Her cousin’s voice behind her made her
start; it was so full of concentrated fury.
“Let her go, you scoundrel! Sydney, leave
the room, dear; that man isn’t fit to speak
to you!”</p>

<p>She pulled her hands away, and stood
between the two, trembling from head to foot.
Sir Algernon lost in his anger the last vestige
of his self-control.</p>

<p>“If I’m unfit to speak to her, what are
you, St. Quentin?” he snarled. “A cheat—a
liar—a trickster—a——”</p>

<p>“How dare you!” Sydney cried, flinging
herself on her knees beside her cousin’s couch
as though to protect him. “Leave the room,
please!”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t cling about him if you knew
what I know. What everybody else shall
shortly know!” Sir Algernon said between his
teeth. “He is——”</p>

<p>Sydney had left childhood behind her as she
faced him with clear, scornful eyes that met his
fearlessly.</p>

<p>“You need not trouble to say any more,”
she said, “for I do not believe one word that
you say against my Cousin St. Quentin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>In the stillness that followed a footman
knocked and came in with a something on
a salver. “A telegram for Sir Algernon, my
lord,” he said.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon tore it open and read it,
changing colour as he did so, then crumpled
it and tossed it into the very heart of the
blazing fire. “I have to write an answer for
the post,” he said. “Au revoir, Quin; we’ll
finish our talk when reluctantly deprived of
Miss Lisle’s society. Miss Lisle, if you still
doubt what I said about St. Quentin, ask <em>him</em>
what I meant. <em>He</em> knows.”</p>

<p>He went out hurriedly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">ST. QUENTIN’S STORY</span></h2>

<p>St. Quentin looked at Sydney’s earnest face
in silence for a moment, then spoke abruptly:</p>

<p>“Sit down. I’ve a good mind to tell you a
story which will make you understand—well,
a good many things—among others what a
contemptible cad I really am. It isn’t a
particularly pretty story, but you may as well
know all about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe <em>one word</em> Sir Algernon said
about you,” she answered, flushing. “Don’t
tell me anything, St. Quentin. I don’t want
to hear!”</p>

<p>“A part of what he said was true, none the
less,” he answered steadily. “Listen. You
know Bridge is five or six years my senior,
and he patronised me when I was a little chap
in turn-down collars at Eton. Of course he
left years before I did; but when I went into
the Guards he was a captain in my regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and the old intimacy grew up again. I was
a young fool and flattered by the friendship,
as I thought it, of a man who had seen the
world. Well, luckily you’ve had no chance of
knowing what fools youngsters in the Guards
<em>can</em> make of themselves!</p>

<p>“My father paid my debts again and again,
until he grew sick of it, and said I must
resign my commission: he couldn’t stand any
more.</p>

<p>“I was sobered by that, for my father and
mother were awfully cut up about it, and I
knew they had treated me far better than ever
I deserved. I <em>did</em> try to pull up then, and
pretty soon—no, don’t stir the fire, I like the
dark—I got to know a girl ... it doesn’t
matter who, except that she was a great deal
too good for me.... She was interested in
the cottages, like you are, Sydney. You remind
me of her now and then, and she was
just eighteen when first I knew her, nine years
ago.</p>

<p>“Well, my extravagance had crippled my
father, and he couldn’t do half he wanted for
his cottages. She minded that a good deal,
I remember. I felt quite certain that if she
would only be engaged to me, I should find
it impossible to be reckless or extravagant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
again; but her father wouldn’t hear of an engagement
then, and even <em>she</em> said I must give
proof of being trustworthy.</p>

<p>“It was at this time, when I was half
maddened by the constant restrictions laid
upon our intercourse, that I chanced on Bridge
again. We had never quite dropped each
other; and when he left the Guards and went
into a regiment of Dragoons which was
quartered at Donisbro’ he came and looked
me up at St. Quentin. We saw a lot of each
other, and I introduced him at the——to the
girl’s father, and he went to the house a good
deal. She never liked him much, though, I
fancy.... I was sick to death of home and
a quiet life and trying to take an interest in
the estate and tenants, as my father wished,
and was ready enough to join in the diversions
of the officers. There wasn’t much harm in
that—they were mostly a good set, but it was
a rich regiment, and I found the money going
faster than I liked.</p>

<p>“I had always been noted in the Guards for
my horses—so was Bridge. I know we got
talking horses one day, and bets passed about
the respective mettle of my favourite, Bridge’s,
and another chap’s—young Gibbs, who also
fancied himself as a judge of horse-flesh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Somehow a race was arranged, and we got our
jockeys and each put a horse in training.</p>

<p>“I was mad, I think, for I took enormous
bets on my MacIvor beating the other two
hollow. I somehow felt that I <em>must</em> win, and
then you see I could have recouped myself for
my losses at cards, and started fair again; at
least I thought I could—that sort of fair start
isn’t worth much, really. The only kind of
fair start that is any good is to set your
face against temptation: that’s the kind <em>she</em>
wanted.</p>

<p>“My people were at Nice just then. My
mother had been ill. If they had been at
home I could hardly have gone so far. But
I was pretty desperate, and everybody knew
it. That made things look all the blacker for
me later on.... Two days before the race
I got thrown, and broke my right arm. I
was cut about the head too, and Lorry kept
me in bed, though I was wild to be up and
doing. Then, as I couldn’t go to the race, I
did the idiotic act which ruined me, though I
didn’t really get much worse than I deserved.
I wrote to my jockey Duncombe, urging him
to win the race at all costs, and promising him
a heavy sum extra to his pay if he did.</p>

<p>“I remember one of the expressions that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
used was ‘pull the show through somehow—anyhow!’</p>

<p>“It was a feverish, excited kind of scrawl,
and, after I’d sent it, I got worse and didn’t
know much about anything for the next week.
Then Bridge came to see me, and what do
you think he said?</p>

<p>“The bets had been far heaviest on us two,
Gibbs wasn’t in it ... but it was he who
pulled the race off, after all. Bridge’s horse
had been hurt, and fell at the first fence;
and then my jockey seemed to lose his head
altogether, all the lookers-on said. Do you
know why? No, you wouldn’t; but they did.
Bridge was ready to kill his man, Grey, for
not watching the horse carefully enough, and
he split on my jockey Duncombe, whom he
had seen lurking round the stable the night
before the race. Duncombe, to save himself,
told Bridge he had injured Bridge’s horse by
<em>my</em> orders, and showed up the letter I had
written him, as proof. Everything was against
me, from the expressions I had used in it to
the fact that it was written in what looked
like a disguised hand and was unsigned. (Lorry
came as I was finishing it, and I knew he
would stop my writing, and threw it into
an envelope without waiting to put any more.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bridge didn’t make the letter public. He
just bought it off the jockey and came to me.
He absolutely refused to believe what I told
him of my innocence, but offered to suppress
the letter if I would pay him an appalling
sum in hush-money. I told him to go to
Jericho at first, but when I got up again, I
realised how fishy it all looked for me, and
how, if that letter were published, it would
be taken as absolute proof of my guilt. I
felt—I told you that I was and am a coward—that
it would break my father’s heart, and I
couldn’t bear—<em>her</em>—to think that I had done
the thing. I went to the Jews, raised the
sum upon a post-obit, and paid Bridge his
hush-money. He told his brother-officers he
was satisfied I had no hand in the laming
of the horse, but he didn’t destroy the letter.
He has it now, and at intervals blackmails
me with a threat of publication if I won’t pay
him for his silence. I have done so hitherto.</p>

<p>“That’s about all, Sydney. You see now
why Bridge is here, and why I can’t do my
duty by my tenants. That motor-smash was
about the best thing that could happen to me,
I suppose, and if I weren’t so abominably
strong, I should have left a better Lisle than
I am in possession some time ago.... If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
weren’t for the old name that has been handed
down pretty clean from father to son all along
the line, I’d have let Bridge publish the letter
long ago,” he added bitterly. “<em>She</em> wrote
to me just after I had been fool enough to
pay Bridge his hush-money. She must have
heard the rumours against me and believed
in them. She wrote, giving no reason, but
saying all must be over between us. That
was all—I think it was enough!”</p>

<p>A light dawned on Sydney, as she thought
about another story she had heard not so
very long ago. She knelt down beside him,
and laid her hands on his.</p>

<p>“I know I’m not much good,” she said,
“but, Cousin St. Quentin, I <em>do</em> care for you,
in spite of this. <em>Why</em> didn’t you go and tell
the girl all about it—just everything, as you
have told me? Mother says if you love people
really you must go on loving even if they do
wrong, because the real love that is put into
us is a bit of God. That girl would have gone
on loving you—I know she would.”</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness I had let Bridge do his
worst!” said St. Quentin. “I wish I’d had
the pluck to do the right thing then, instead
of wasting the money that was given me to
use, not chuck away. Now you know why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I’m telling Fane to ruin the estate my ancestors
took pride in by cutting down the timber at
the bidding of that man! Because I was too
great a coward to do the right thing first—when
I could.”</p>

<p>Sydney looked her cousin in the face.</p>

<p>“Please forgive me if I am very impertinent,
St. Quentin,” she said earnestly. “You say
you wish that you had done the right thing
then.” She hesitated for an instant, and then
spoke the last words firmly: “You wish that you
had done it then—why don’t you do it now?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHAIN BROKEN</span></h2>

<p>For a full minute there was silence in the
big room. Then St. Quentin looked up.</p>

<p>“It’s rather late in the day,” he said, “but
possibly better late than never. Sydney, will
you write a letter for me?”</p>

<p>She thought of another letter she had written
for him more than two months ago, but there
was a considerable difference in the subject
matter of that letter and to-day’s.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Fane</span>,”—he dictated—“we must
have five hundred pounds’ worth of timber
down as soon as possible, as I want fresh
cottages to replace those in Water Lane
and Foxholes. Have workmen over immediately.
This rebuilding is by the wish of
my heir, Miss Lisle.”</p>

<p>“Now bring it me to sign,” her cousin said.</p>

<p>She brought it, and, as she gave him his
pen, she did what she had never done before,
she stooped and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t like to tell you before,” she cried,
“because you said you could do nothing for
the cottages, but Mrs. Sawyer is ill, and when
I went to see her this afternoon she said she
never would be better while she lived in that
cottage. Will she have one of the new ones,
St. Quentin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll mark hers for pulling down.
We’ll do this business thoroughly while we’re
about it, beginning with Lislehurst, but going on
to the rest.”</p>

<p>He wrote his signature large and clearly.
As he did so, Sir Algernon came back into
the room. He glanced at the letter.</p>

<p>“So you’ve done it. I say, my dear fellow,
philanthropy is all very well, but you can’t
afford it at present.”</p>

<p>“Since when did I give you leave to read
my private letters?” asked St. Quentin drily.
As he spoke he placed the letter in an envelope,
directed it, and put it into Sydney’s hand.</p>

<p>“One of the men is to take it over to Fane’s
place at once,” he said.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon stood between the girl and
the door. “You’re mad, Quin! You’ll have
enough to do to raise my screw, without
attempting any more.”</p>

<p>“Let Miss Lisle pass,” said St. Quentin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
quietly. “On the proverbial second thoughts,
which we all know to be not only better, but
best, I have changed my mind. Publish
Duncombe’s letter if you choose! I’ll not pay
a farthing more to stop you, nor will Miss
Lisle when she comes of age. That’s all.
Sydney,”—the girl was at the door—“tell
somebody to let Bridge’s man know that he
finds he has to catch the 8.15 to town to-night.”</p>

<p>The girl went out, the precious note in her
hand and a tumult of joy in her heart.</p>

<p>That horrible Sir Algernon was leaving, and
St. Quentin, of his own freewill, was going to
rebuild his neglected cottages. She felt she
could have danced, despite the dignity of her
eighteen years.</p>

<p>In the entrance hall she met the old doctor,
struggling out of his wet mackintosh and
goloshes. “<em>What</em> a night!” he exclaimed.
“But this disgusting weather seems to suit
you, my dear Miss Lisle. You are looking
blooming, if you will allow an old man to say
so. How is your cousin, eh? Moped a bit
this dreary day, no doubt? Meant to look in
upon him earlier to see if he fancied a chat,
but I was kept in the village. And that
reminds me, my dear young lady, I shouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
go to Loam for a day or two, if I were you;
they’ve got something about there that I don’t
quite like the look of. I’ve been warning
the Vicar; that boy of his follows him about
like a dog to all the cottages. Not that this
kind of low fever is infectious, but you may
take my word for it that where there’s fever
there’s a reason for it. So don’t you go to
Loam till I give you leave. Not that I’m
anxious, you know, not at all.”</p>

<p>Sydney thought the old doctor was rather
more anxious than he cared to own. His face
was considerably graver than usual as he walked
across the hall to the door of the library.</p>

<p>As he reached it, Sydney, who had followed
him, caught his hand with a cry of terror.
“Oh, go in quickly!” she cried.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon had been almost stunned by
astonishment for the first few minutes after
Sydney had left the room with the letter which
practically spelt defeat to him. There was a
changed, drawn look about his face, when at
length he recovered himself sufficiently to
speak.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean what you said just now?”
he demanded hoarsely.</p>

<p>“I do. Will you dine before you leave,
Bridge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, confound you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t make a scene, it is quite unnecessary.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon laughed rather wildly, and
played his last card.</p>

<p>“You won’t be able to take that high line
much longer, my good fellow!” he snarled,
fumbling in his pocket-book. “I’ll just refresh
your memory on the subject of the
expressions used by you in that precious letter
before it—goes to press!”</p>

<p>St. Quentin’s tone was calm enough. “Do.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon drew out the dirty envelope
on which “Re Duncombe” was scrawled in
his own hand, and pulled from it a letter in
the cramped left-hand writing.</p>

<p>“Here we are. Some of these expressions
will look rather fine in print, I fancy; the
Society papers will have a treat. Why——”</p>

<p>A violent exclamation burst from him, as
he stared wildly, first at the letter in his
hand, then at the envelope, and back at the
letter again.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked St. Quentin.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon came quickly towards him.
“You made me do it!” he hissed. “You
made me burn your note to Duncombe. Your
letter to me and to Duncombe were in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
other’s envelopes, and you made me burn the
wrong one!” His voice, loud, harsh, and
grating in his fury, rang out into the hall,
despite the heavy curtain over the door of
the library. “You made me do it, and
I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” said St. Quentin, vaguely
aware as he spoke that all might well be over
before Dickson had the time to answer his
ring. “It wouldn’t take a great deal to finish
me, you see, and Lorry would require an
explanation.”</p>

<p>“He does!” the old doctor cried, hurrying
into the room with Sydney at his heels. “May
I ask what you’re doing, Sir Algernon? Get
a little farther off from my patient, if you
please.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” said St. Quentin,
“Bridge and I were only discussing my new
scheme for rebuilding the cottages. But,
interesting as I find his views, I am afraid
we shall have to close the discussion, as he
has a train to catch. Good-bye, Bridge.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon turned fiercely upon him.</p>

<p>“You think you’ve won the game and can
keep your secret in your hands. You can’t!
Miss Morrell read the letter. I showed it to
her, and she read it and asked what it meant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I told her and she believed in me—not you!
not you!”</p>

<p>“She did <em>not</em>!” said Sydney, “for she told
me all about it. She believed in it just at
first, because she did not know how wicked
you could be, Sir Algernon. But by-and-by,
when she grew older, she knew that St.
Quentin could not possibly have done what
you accused him of. She didn’t understand
about the letter to the jockey; but she just
knew that St. Quentin could not possibly be
mean or dishonourable. And she knows you
are both!”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” said Dr. Lorry, in a very
audible aside, and Sir Algernon, muttering
some indistinguishable remark about his train,
went out.</p>

<p>“Lord St. Quentin, your heir is a trump!”
the old doctor said enthusiastically, and St.
Quentin, as he bade good-night to Sydney,
agreed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">PAULY’S BIRTHDAY</span></h2>

<p>A small army of workmen had appeared at
Lislehurst, and the village folk were beginning
to realise the incredible fact that their marquess
did at length intend to do his duty
by them, when Pauly’s fifth birthday came
round.</p>

<p>“May I have him to tea with me?” Sydney
asked, and on receiving permission began to
make extensive preparations in the way of
good cheer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fewkes was easily induced to devote
her energies to the making of a truly stupendous
cake, conical in shape and covered with
white sugar, adorned with amazing flowers
and fruits of all colours. And there were birds,
butterflies, and beetles made of chocolate upon
it, and five pink candles fixed around its topmost
peak, to signify the five years which the
small birthday king would have reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Not content with this marvel of confectionery,
Mrs. Fewkes further added dishes of
cream, buns, and other delicacies for which she
was deservedly famous, so altogether Pauly’s
birthday tea bid fair to be a very great success.</p>

<p>It was spread in the school-room, and on
his plate was seated a large furry toy dog, with
red tongue hanging out in a <i lang="fr">dégagé</i> manner,
and a spring which, when pressed, caused him
to jump uncertainly about, and also bark in
a thin and spasmodic way. This was Sydney’s
present to the hero of the day. Miss Osric
had contributed a box of bricks, which stood
upon his chair.</p>

<p>All was in readiness at four o’clock, when
Pauly arrived in charge of his nurse, looking
rather extra fat and red about the cheeks,
Sydney thought.</p>

<p>He was immensely excited over something
and would not wait, as she suggested, to take
off his little overcoat upstairs, but insisted on
removing it the very moment he had set two
rather muddy little feet inside the hall.</p>

<p>The reason of his eagerness was soon
apparent. The blouse and bunchy petticoats
were raiment of the past; Pauly was attired
in all the glories of his first sailor suit!</p>

<p>Sydney knelt down beside the small sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
figure and kissed the round important little
face. “Why, Pauly, you <em>are</em> splendid! and
what a great big boy you look to-day!”</p>

<p>“As big as Daddy?” he enquired.</p>

<p>“Ever so much bigger than you looked
when first I saw you,” Sydney answered,
evading the question with dexterity. “Isn’t
he a man to-day, Miss Osric?”</p>

<p>Miss Osric admired duly, and then suggested
an adjournment to the school-room. But Pauly
stood like a rock, his legs planted wide apart
and his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Want to show my twousers to Mrs.
Fewkes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you can’t, little man,” said Miss
Osric.</p>

<p>“Come, Pauly!” Sydney cried.</p>

<p>He did not budge.</p>

<p>“Want to show my twousers to Mr.
Gweaves.”</p>

<p>Sydney and Miss Osric exchanged puzzled
glances. What was to be done? Of course
he was naughty, but neither liked to scold him
on a birthday.</p>

<p>Sydney had recourse to coaxing.</p>

<p>“There is such a lovely cake upstairs,” she
said, “a cake as high as that.” She held her
hand some distance from the floor. “It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sugar all over it and such lovely fruits and sweets,
white and pink, and all kinds of nice things
upon it. Don’t you want to see it, Pauly?”</p>

<p>He scorned bribery. “Want to show my
twousers to the ill one!”</p>

<p>“What, dear?”</p>

<p>“To the ill one. Want to show my twousers
to the ill one!”</p>

<p>“Lord St. Quentin, I suppose he means,”
Miss Osric said aside to Sydney. “But I don’t
think he would like to see the child, do you?”</p>

<p>Sydney was rather doubtful. “There is
something so wonderful upstairs in your plate,
Pauly,” she assured him insidiously; “something
that has such a nice funny voice, and
jumps about too, doesn’t it, Miss Osric?”</p>

<p>Pauly put one irresolute foot forward in
the direction of the bear-guarded staircase,
and then drew it back again.</p>

<p>“Want to show my twousers to the ill one,”
he said, in the same loud sing-song voice as
he had used before.</p>

<p>It is sad to relate that two grown-up girls
were worsted by this scrap of manhood
wearing to-day manly garb for the first time.
Sydney rose from her knees and went toward
the library. “I will ask St. Quentin,” she
said, feeling rather small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Her cousin seemed rather tickled by the
story of the fight.</p>

<p>“Oh, bring him to me, by all means!” he
said. “Upon my word! that boy ought to
make a Prime Minister. He has enough
force of character for anything. Tell him
the ‘ill one’ will be <em>charmed</em> to see the
trousers!”</p>

<p>Sydney led the boy in, whispering to him
not to make a noise, for Lord St. Quentin
was very tired.</p>

<p>“<em>Never</em> make a noise,” he assured her, without
much regard for truth.</p>

<p>St. Quentin surveyed his small visitor with
fixed and flattering attention. “Hullo!” he
said, “what’s this huge chap coming in? The
Vicar himself, I suppose? Oh, his son, is it,
Sydney? Well, how are you, eh, Paul? Is
that your name? Going to shake hands with
me—that’s right. I suppose you’re seven at
least, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I am five,” Pauly said, with modest
elation.</p>

<p>“Dear me! and I’m thirty-five and not
half so proud of it. And these are the new
trousers. Upon my word! they’re remarkably
fine specimens, aren’t they, Sydney? You
want a pinch for your new clothes, don’t you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
youngster? or would you rather have a
sixpence to put into each of those trouser
pockets? What, you would rather have the
sixpences? That’s odd, isn’t it? There,
put them in your pockets, and now you may
run away; only don’t eat <em>quite</em> all the cake
Miss Lisle has provided for you, or you won’t
be able to walk home! He looks as if he
eats too much already,” he concluded aside
to Sydney. “What a colour the child has!”</p>

<p>“He is a good deal redder than usual,
and fatter-looking too,” Sydney said. “I
have never seen him look quite like this
before.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t stuff him too much,” said her
cousin, and the two went out.</p>

<p>St. Quentin’s caution was not needed. For
once Pauly did not seem hungry, even for
cake. He was delighted with his dog and
kept it on his knee all through tea-time, but
though he set up a little shout of joy at the
sight of the splendid cake, he only played
with the noble slice that Sydney cut for
him, and couldn’t be persuaded to be hungry
even when “Carlo” was made to bark for
crumbs!</p>

<p>“I don’t think the child is well,” said Miss
Osric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>They gave up coaxing him to eat after
that, and all three sat upon the hearth-rug,
building, with Miss Osric’s bricks, a most
wonderful kennel for Carlo.</p>

<p>For a little while Pauly seemed happy, and
laughed merrily enough, then suddenly, without
apparent reason, he began to cry.</p>

<p>Sydney, who had never seen the manly
little fellow shed tears yet for any reason
whatsoever, was alarmed.</p>

<p>She gathered him into her arms and tried
to find out what was wrong. “What is it,
Pauly, darling? Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p>“Want Daddy?” Pauly sobbed, nor could
they comfort him.</p>

<p>Sydney had risen to ring and order the
pony-carriage, thinking that she and Miss Osric
had better take their little visitor back at once
to the daddy he was crying for, when one of
the footmen came up to the school-room to announce
“Mr. Seaton is come for Master Paul.”</p>

<p>Sydney ran downstairs to ask if Mr. Seaton
were walking, and to offer the pony-carriage.
The Vicar was looking very tired and grave,
and seemed in a hurry to be off. He said he
had been visiting in the village all the afternoon:
there was a great deal of illness about.
“I think you must discontinue your working-party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
for a week or two, Miss Lisle,” he said.
“Dr. Lorry thinks Mrs. Sawyer is suffering
from some kind of low fever; the same thing
which seems prevalent in Loam. Don’t go
into her cottage for a day or two, at all events,
till we see how things are. I am keeping
Pauly from the village now.”</p>

<p>Declining the offer of the pony-carriage,
he took his small son, quiet now that he had
got his daddy, and still clasping Carlo, in
his arms, and the two went out together.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">HUGH TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>“Fever epidemic in Blankshire. Medical
help urgently required. The villages specially
affected by the fever, are Loam, Hurstleigh,
Marston, Styles, and Lislehurst—all on the
estate of the Marquess of St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“The epidemic is of a very serious nature.
The Chief Sanitary Inspector of Donisbro’
visited the affected villages upon the outbreak
of the illness, and declares the cottages to
be in a greatly neglected condition.</p>

<p>“The local physician has applied for help
to the staff of the London Hospitals.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hugh Chichester read these words in the
hall of the Blue-friars Hospital, as he and
another young doctor waited for a “case,”
which was being brought in from the street.</p>

<p>“Estate of the Marquess of St. Quentin,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
his companion commented. “Isn’t that the
chap who had that frightful motor-smash three
months ago? Why, hullo! Chichester, old
man! Are you off your head?”</p>

<p>For Hugh had flung himself into the lift
without a word, and was swooping upward
to the first floor, where he knew that he would
find his father.</p>

<p>The doctor was free for the moment, but
Hugh knew that he himself was not. He
only paused to thrust the paper in his father’s
hand, with a hoarse “Read that,” and was
down the staircase and in the hall again, before
the “case,” upon its stretcher, had crossed
the wide open paved courtyard of the Blue-friars
Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester was quick of understanding,
as doctors generally are.</p>

<p>“You want to go to Blankshire, my boy?”
he said, when he and his son met for their
hastily-snatched luncheon.</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>“I think it may be possible,” the doctor
said. “Help is certainly needed, to judge from
the papers, and I would not hold you back.
But, my boy, you must remember it may mean
the loss of your post here, unless the Hospital
elects to send you to Blankshire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh nodded.</p>

<p>“And, Hugh,” his father went on, “you
must give me your word that you keep away
from Sydney. It won’t be easy, but I know
that I can trust you to think of her and not
yourself. You want to spare her from suffering
what you suffer. You will prove yourself her
true ‘servant’ in this, as ‘Dorothy Osborne’
would say to us. If you can trust yourself
to keep clear of intercourse with her, I think
that you are right to volunteer your services.
I should have done so myself years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll keep away from her,” Hugh
muttered, and the doctor said, “All right, my
boy, I trust you. We will see what your
mother says to sending you to Blankshire.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Chichester said “Yes.” Perhaps
those little snatches of fireside talk, for which
big bearded sons on the other side of the
world grow homesick, had made her understand
her boy with that absolute understanding
sympathy which only mothers have the power
to give.</p>

<p>“Yes, you must go, my Hugh,” she said,
“for you will be able to help those poor people,
and I know that you will be my unselfish son,
as you have always been, and make it easy
for Sydney.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will, mother,” Hugh said, and so packed
his things and offered his services to Dr. Lorry.</p>

<p>The old doctor met him at Dacreshaw
Station; he was looking older and his cheery
utterances came out with an effort.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you, Mr. Chichester,
extremely glad; for I can’t deny that this
fever is a very serious one, and the condition
of the cottages is so much against the poor
people’s chances of recovery. Still, I have
no doubt, no, none at all, that, with your able
assistance, we shall soon see a marked improvement.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t got it at the Castle, have
they?” Hugh asked anxiously as he climbed
up into the high dog-cart by the old doctor’s
side, and was driven rapidly along the muddy
country roads towards Lislehurst.</p>

<p>“No! no!” Dr. Lorry said, “and I see
no real reason why they should. Lady
Frederica is extremely anxious to carry off
Miss Lisle to town, but I have endeavoured
to dissuade her. Miss Lisle has been so much
about among the cottages of late, that I am
anxious—not about her, oh dear no! but
anxious, I repeat, to have her under my
own eye for a day or two longer. And it
is not as though she ran any risk in remaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
as I have assured Lord St. Quentin. These
low fevers cannot well be called infectious.”
He relapsed into silence,—an unusual state
with him—which lasted till they reached Lislehurst,
and his own gate. They got down and
a man took the cob’s head. “Now we are at
my house, my dear—er, Chichester,” he said,
rousing himself, “and perhaps, when you have
lunched, you would not mind coming round
with me to see the little boy at the Vicarage,
who is, I fear, in a rather critical condition.”
Hugh started. “Little Paul ill! I will
come at once, if you don’t mind, sir.”</p>

<p>“You will come at once? Well, if you are
not fatigued, I own it would be a relief.
His condition is decidedly critical, and your
science is a good deal fresher than mine.
Not that I take at all a hopeless view of
his case, far from it!” the old doctor said,
blowing his nose rather fiercely; “but he’s his
father’s only child, sir, and—motherless.”</p>

<p>Hugh was already hurrying out into the
village by the old doctor’s side. “Little
Pauly ill!—that jolly little chap!” he kept
on saying, and he walked so fast that the
old man could hardly keep pace with him.</p>

<p>There was a strange silence in the village.
Hardly any children were playing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
road. “We had to shut the schools,” said
Dr. Lorry.</p>

<p>The village seemed almost as though it
held its breath and waited for some stroke
to fall.</p>

<p>Hugh looked up at the tall, grey tower of
Lislehurst Church as they passed beneath it,
and thought of little Pauly as he had been on
that bright December morning, full of life and
mischief. It seemed incredible to imagine
illness or death coming near him.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry followed the direction of his
eyes.</p>

<p>“The Vicar told me of that morning on
the tower,” he said. “You saved the boy
once, Chichester; please God, you’ll save him
again.”</p>

<p>The Vicarage nursery was a good deal
changed from the cheerful room where Sydney
had sat on her first morning in Blankshire.
The toys, no longer wanted, were pushed aside
and put away in cupboards; their absence
giving a curiously forlorn appearance to the
room.</p>

<p>Sickroom appliances had taken their place,
and the little iron cot, from which Pauly’s
restless fingers used to scrape the paint on
summer mornings when getting-up time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
seemed long in coming, was pulled into the
centre of the room.</p>

<p>Pauly’s thick red curls had been cropped
close to his head for coolness, and the sturdy,
roundabout figure was shrunk to a mere
shadow of its former self. It was hard to
believe him the same child who had displayed
the glory of his first knickerbockers with such
pride at the Castle only a short week ago!</p>

<p>Beside the little cot the Vicar stood, very
quiet, as he had been all through the illness,
but with eyes that asked more questions than
his lips.</p>

<p>But he held out his hand to Hugh with
a look which showed that he had not forgotten
that morning on the church tower in the midst
of all this trouble.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chichester indeed! I could hardly
believe Dr. Lorry’s new colleague to be you.
This is luck. I am very glad.”</p>

<p>His eyes were searching Hugh’s face as he
spoke, as if to read there what he thought of
little Pauly.</p>

<p>“These young men have all the science
nowadays,” old Dr. Lorry said, in a very
audible aside. “We’ll see him work wonders
with the boy, please God!”</p>

<p>Pauly was lying in a sort of restless doze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and they would not wake him. One arm
clasped Carlo’s black form to his heart.</p>

<p>“He wakes and cries for that beast if he
finds it gone,” the Vicar whispered, with a
sad little smile. “Tell Miss Lisle when you
see her, Lorry.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the elder men watched Hugh
with a pathetic eagerness as he bent above
the little cot, feeling the wasted wrist, and
listening to the uncertain breathing.</p>

<p>“These young men ... more scientific
treatment,” the old doctor said again and again,
in a husky whisper. But all Hugh said was,
“I should like to consult with Dr. Lorry over
a new treatment.”</p>

<p>Further directions having been given to the
nurse, who seemed a capable kind of person,
the doctors took their departure, and Mr.
Seaton accompanied them out.</p>

<p>“You coming, Vicar?” Dr. Lorry questioned
with surprise in his tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Seaton said. “I must do some
visiting. Mine is not the only house in trouble
to-day.”</p>

<p>And with a last look at Pauly, lying in his
cot, he passed out with the doctors from the
shadowed Vicarage.</p>

<p>Where the road to the village skirted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Park they met Sydney, alone. She was
walking fast, and with her head bent down:
she did not see them till they were quite close
to her. Then she looked up suddenly, and
a quick flush overspread her pale face. She
hesitated for a moment: then went forward
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>Hugh found himself taking it and speaking
to her as a mere acquaintance.</p>

<p>He had seen the account of the epidemic
in the papers, and the Blue-friars had given
him permission to volunteer his services. He
was glad to have met Sydney to-day, as he
should be—very busy—he expected, and there
would be no seeing anybody, he believed.</p>

<p>And there he broke off, stammering, as the
clear eyes seemed to ask the meaning of this
strange manner from her brother Hugh, who
had said at their last parting that “he understood.”</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence of full a
minute before Sydney recollected herself and
asked after Pauly. “Thank you, he is very
ill,” said Pauly’s father.</p>

<p>And then Dr. Lorry, whose kind eyes had
seen a good deal during Hugh’s rather halting
explanation, interposed with professional
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Lisle, my dear young lady, you really
must not stand about in the cold; you are
looking quite chilled. Take an old man’s
advice, walk home as fast as you can, and
have a good cup of chocolate or cocoa as soon
as you get to the Castle.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Sydney, and the three
men took the small tan-gloved hand again,
and passed on to their work.</p>

<p>And Sydney passed on also, thinking with
a strange, sore feeling in her heart, that Hugh
had changed a good deal. He had not even
seemed pleased to see her: Hugh—who had
been her special friend from babyhood!</p>

<p>Had there ever been a time when Hugh
had not wanted her before? She could not
recollect it, if there were. How many times
had she not sat beside a big, long-limbed
school-boy, doing his preparation at the school-room
table, with its much-kicked legs and
much-inked table cover, and been proud to
think she was “helping Hugh” when she
blotted his exercises, or held the book, while
he reeled off pages in some tongue unknown
to her!</p>

<p>Had he ever failed to seem pleased when
she offered her assistance, even when he was
working with a pucker on his forehead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ten fingers running through his hair? He
had always seemed to want the little Sydney
in an inky pinafore, however busy he might
be; but now he had changed.</p>

<p>“He did not think he should see her
again—he would be very busy.” Could the
Hugh of old days have spoken to her in that
cool, indifferent tone? Sydney felt sure that
he could not. For the first time the girl
found the homeward walk too far for her
active feet. The distance seemed unending
through the Park.</p>

<p>Pauly was very ill, very likely going to
die, and Hugh—Hugh did not care to see
her any more.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">FEVER-STRICKEN</span></h2>

<p>“Cousin St. Quentin,” Sydney said, coming
straight into the library, “I want to tell you
that I saw and spoke to Hugh to-day. You
must forgive me, please, this time—I won’t
again.”</p>

<p>Her cousin looked at her with a curious
expression in his eyes: at another time she
would have been surprised to see no anger there
at her confession, but now she did not seem
to be surprised at anything. Pauly was very
ill—perhaps going to die—and Hugh had not
cared to see her. Nothing else seemed to
matter very much.</p>

<p>“Are you ill, Sydney?” Her cousin spoke
to her twice before she heard him.</p>

<p>She put her hands to her head. “I don’t
know; my head aches rather.”</p>

<p>“Go and lie down,” said St. Quentin.
“You’ve been worrying about that poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
chap at the Vicarage. Lie down till luncheon;
then you will feel better.”</p>

<p>She felt dimly that his tone was kind in
spite of her disobedience with regard to Hugh.
With a sudden impulse she knelt down beside
his couch and laid her head upon his hand.
“I shall not disobey you again,” she said, “for
Hugh—Hugh doesn’t care, I think, to see
me now.”</p>

<p>She was on her feet again, and had left the
room before he had time to answer her.</p>

<p>St. Quentin gazed after her with a softened
look in his tired grey eyes. “Poor little
soul!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry looked in at the Castle as Lady
Frederica and Miss Osric were sitting down
to luncheon. Sydney had fallen asleep on the
sofa in the morning-room, and Miss Osric
would not rouse her. The old doctor refused
luncheon and went to the library at once. His
face was very grave.</p>

<p>“Is the little chap at the Vicarage any
worse?” St. Quentin asked him sharply.</p>

<p>“Very little change since yesterday,” the
old doctor said. “I have great hopes from
young Chichester, and fresh treatment....
These young men, you know, are up in all
the latest developments of science.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does he think of the fever?”</p>

<p>“Badly, I’m afraid. Now the school is
closed he wants it turned into a hospital, and
to borrow nurses from Donisbro’, to work with
the more effective women here. He thinks
the patients will have very little chance of
recovery in their own cottages.”</p>

<p>The marquess winced, then reached his desk
and pen. “How much money will you want
to start with?” he said. “I am, of course,
accountable for all this. Save what lives you
can, and never mind my pocket.”</p>

<p>There was no time for mincing matters.
The doctor told him what would be required,
and St. Quentin drew a cheque for the amount
and signed it.</p>

<p>“Let me know when more is wanted,” he
said. “And now will you go upstairs and look
at Sydney. I think she needs change. If you
agree, Lady Frederica shall take her off to
the South of France somewhere to set her up
after all this.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry made no comment upon this
suggestion, but went quietly upstairs to Sydney.
She was awake now, looking rather better
for her sleep and eating a basin of soup, which
Miss Osric had brought her.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry sat down beside her on the sofa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
felt her pulse, looked into her eyes, and asked
if she would like to go to bed.</p>

<p>“I think you would be more comfortable
there,” he said, and Sydney did not contradict
him.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked St. Quentin anxiously, as
Dr. Lorry re-entered the brown library a few
minutes later. “How about the South of
France—or do you think sea air would be
better for her?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t recommend you to consider
the idea of change quite at once,” the old
doctor observed cautiously. “You see, Miss
Lisle has been a good deal about among the
cottages, and——”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for her needing
change!”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes; but that cottage where she held
her meeting for the women was, I regret to
say, in a most unhealthy condition, owing to
defective drains, and——”</p>

<p>“I know; it was one I had marked to be
pulled down!”</p>

<p>“Miss Lisle was in it for two hours twice
a week, and oftener when that poor woman
first fell ill,” the doctor persisted, as though
his keen old eyes failed to see that the subject
of the neglected cottages was a very sore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
one to their owner. He hated himself, as
he saw how the thin face flushed beneath
his words, but something had to be said, and
he said it.</p>

<p>“So I should not recommend your worrying
over sending Miss Lisle away from home at
present.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” St. Quentin had
turned upon him like a flash and caught his
hand as in a vice. “What is it? Don’t say
the child is ill! Good heavens! <em>not</em> the
fever!”</p>

<p>“Remember, she will have every possible
advantage,” the old doctor faltered, “every
chance that anybody could have of complete
recovery. There is no need to be at all
despondent, but I fear—don’t agitate yourself—I
fear we must not deceive ourselves into the
belief that she is going to escape the fever.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten long days had gone by—the longest,
Mr. Fenton thought, that he had ever known.</p>

<p>He had come straight down to the Castle
on hearing of Sydney’s illness, to do what
he could for Lord St. Quentin, under this
fresh calamity which had fallen on what really
seemed a doomed house.</p>

<p>He sat with the marquess in the library,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
except when, morning and evening, he walked
down to the improvised hospital to get the
latest news of the battle raging there.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was Dr. Lorry, with the
trimness gone from his person and his eyes
a little bloodshot, who would come out and
report to the lawyer waiting there in the
deserted play-ground. Sometimes Hugh’s tall
form and young haggard face would emerge
from the school-door; or sometimes Miss
Morrell, who had come from Donisbro’ when
the doctors were at their wits’ end to find
sufficient and efficient nurses, and had stayed
ever since, toiling with the rest to save the
many sick.</p>

<p>Or sometimes it was the Vicar, striding
between the Vicarage and the hospital, who
would stay to deliver his report upon the
fight which he was sharing with the doctors
and the nurses.</p>

<p>And Mr. Fenton would go back to Lord
St. Quentin, lying staring dumbly at the fire,
and thinking—thinking of that Christmas Day,
when the girl who lay upstairs in the grip
of fever had asked him if he could do nothing
for the cottages. If he had <em>only</em> done it then,
when she had asked him, what anxiety and
distress would have been obviated!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are saving so many,” Mr. Fenton
would say, “and that young Chichester is invaluable.
Dr. Lorry cannot say enough for
him. They are saving so many, that one
cannot help feeling very hopeful for Miss
Lisle.”</p>

<p>“I have no hope,” said St. Quentin.</p>

<p>A specialist from London had come to
see the girl on whom so many hopes were
centred.</p>

<p>“She is very seriously ill,” had been his
verdict—that verdict which seemed so terribly
unsatisfying. “A great deal depends upon
the nursing. There is no need to give up
hope.”</p>

<p>Then he had gone away, leaving those who
loved the girl to make what they could out
of those brief sentences.</p>

<p>“She is very seriously ill.”</p>

<p>“A great deal depends upon the nursing.”</p>

<p>“There is no need to give up hope.”</p>

<p>“She would have made a better job of
the landlord business than I’ve done!” St.
Quentin said to Mr. Fenton, again and again.
“She cared for the people, and when I
wouldn’t do my duty, tried to do it for me!”</p>

<p>“They are quite devoted to her in Lislehurst,
and, indeed, at Loam and Styles as well,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
said Mr. Fenton. “It is most touching to
see the way men and women come rushing
from their cottages as I pass, to ask for the
latest news of her. She has won their
hearts in the short time she has been among
them.”</p>

<p>“She cared for them, and that accounts for
it,” said St. Quentin. “She even cared for
me, though, God knows! I gave her small
cause to do so. I took her from the people
whom she loved, and cut her off as far as
possible from intercourse with them. I made
her unhappy for my own selfish ends, and
now I’m going to lose her!”</p>

<p>“Please God, no,” said Mr. Fenton, but
his voice was not quite steady.</p>

<p>“I would give anything to think I made
her happy——” poor St. Quentin was going
on, when he was checked by the entrance
of a footman.</p>

<p>“Mr. Chichester to see Mr. Fenton, my
lord.”</p>

<p>“Show him in here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenton rose. “Hadn’t I better go
to him?”</p>

<p>“Show him in here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p>The footman withdrew, and in a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Hugh came into the library. He was very
white as he went forward to the man who had
taken Sydney from them. Neither attempted
any conventional greeting, and Mr. Fenton’s
murmured introduction was unheard by both.</p>

<p>“So you are Hugh Chichester?” St. Quentin
said. “Tell me—if I wire to your father and
mother to come down to Sydney, will they
come?”</p>

<p>“Is she worse?” Hugh’s voice was metallic
in the effort that he made to keep it steady.</p>

<p>“No!” St. Quentin spoke so loudly as
to make the lawyer jump. “Tell me, would
they come?”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed unsteadily. The question
seemed to him almost a mockery. “They’d
come to her from the world’s end,” he said.</p>

<p>St. Quentin filled hastily a telegraph form
with the words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Forgive me, and come to Sydney.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">St. Quentin.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>This he directed to “Dr. and Mrs. Chichester”
in full.</p>

<p>“Send it off as you pass the post office,”
he said to Hugh, who took the form and
went out silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the night after the arrival of Dr.
and Mrs. Chichester.</p>

<p>All was very quiet in the nursery at the
Vicarage. At the foot of the little iron cot
knelt the Vicar, his face hidden in his hands.
Hugh was bending over it, his arm under
Pauly’s head, his eyes intently watching the
worn baby face.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry had been sent for to the Castle.
Short as Sydney’s illness had been in comparison
with little Pauly’s, its crisis had come to-night,
and they knew that before the wet February
dawn crept up into the sky they would see
whether life or death were to be the girl’s
portion.</p>

<p>“Put a light in the passage window next
her room, if—when—she turns the corner,”
Hugh had said to Dr. Lorry, when the old
man was summoned to the Castle that evening.
“I <em>must</em> stay with Pauly to-night, but—put
a light in the window! I can see it from
the Vicarage!”</p>

<p>“I will, my boy,” the old doctor said, and
went up to the Castle, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“One” boomed out from the clock upon
the church tower, and Pauly stirred and moaned.
His father was on his feet in a second, but
Hugh signed for silence and put something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in a spoon between the child’s lips. Pauly
cuddled himself close into the circle of the
young man’s arm, and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“Is he going?” whispered the poor father
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Hush!” Hugh said, and there was silence
again.</p>

<p>An hour went slowly by. Hugh was sitting
now upon a high nursery chair beside the
little cot, but sideways, that he might not move
the arm on which the child was resting. Two
struck, and the Vicar, with a long look at the
little wasted face, rose from his knees and
stole out to the hospital.</p>

<p>Three struck, and four: the Vicar had
returned, with a whispered, word to Hugh
that all was well at the hospital and in the
village, and Dr. Mitchell, who had come to
their help, satisfied. Outside it was very
dark. Mr. Seaton rose and looked long and
earnestly from the window.</p>

<p>“Is there a light in the passage next her
room?” Hugh’s voice was hardly more than
a thread of sound.</p>

<p>The Vicar came across and laid a hand upon
the young man’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The nursery clock, ticking on evenly, sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
very loud in the stillness. The nurse stole
into the room to peer round the shaded lamp
at the little patient, and then go away again.</p>

<p>Five struck, and with it came the first
faint sleepy twitter of a half-awakened bird.</p>

<p>Pauly stirred: the Vicar raised his head:
the child looked at his father for a moment
with a half-puzzled smile of recognition; then,
with a little drowsy sound of contentment,
dropped back upon the pillows, peacefully
asleep.</p>

<p>Hugh rose from his cramped posture and
rubbed his stiffened arm. “Thank God!” he
said. Mr. Seaton’s hand closed over his in a
way that was more expressive than any words
had power to be. “The little chap will do
now,” the young doctor told the father gently,
and left him with his child.</p>

<p>He went down the stairs like a man in a
dream, looked into the hospital, and then
directed his steps straight towards the Castle.
The whole world seemed unreal to him to-night;
he was unconscious that he had not
slept or eaten for hours. All his powers seemed
centred on one thought: Was there a light in
that passage window?</p>

<p>The lodge gates had been left open for
the convenience of the doctors, and Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
made his way unopposed through the Park,
where Sydney had gone that first morning.</p>

<p>As he drew near the Castle he saw that
he was not the only watcher. Half a dozen
figures were grouped near the marble steps,
waiting, for the most part, silently. As he
joined them Hugh saw that one was old
Banks the groom, and the rest men from the
village. No one made any comment when
the young doctor stood among them. A
common trouble makes the roughest quick of
understanding.</p>

<p>Old Banks was speaking as Hugh came up
to the little group.</p>

<p>“She were a rare one for the riding,” he
said in a low husky voice. “Bless you! I’ve
put a many up, but never one as took to it
better than she did. And his lordship were
fine and pleased, he were, for I saw the look
in his eyes as we went past they windows of
the library.</p>

<p>“‘Please tell me anything I don’t do right,
Banks,’ she says, as pretty as can be, ‘for
I want to ride well and please my cousin.’”</p>

<p>Hugh went and stood close beside the old
man, and silence fell again upon the little
group of watchers.</p>

<p>“It were <em>her</em> as were all for the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of they new cottages on the hill,” Sawyer said
presently. “Mr. Fane, he told me so himself.
His lordship wrote to him as it were ‘by the
wish of his heir, Miss Lisle.’”</p>

<p>There was another pause, and in the silence
they heard the distant clock upon the church
strike six, followed immediately by the deep
booming notes of the Castle clock above the
stables.</p>

<p>Hugh involuntarily turned his head to hear
from what the deep solemn sounds proceeded.
As he turned old Banks caught his arm in a
convulsive grip—“Look, sir!”</p>

<p>A hand had come to the window in the
passage, dark and shrouded till that moment,
and had left a light there.</p>

<p>A minute later, and the young doctor, of
whose courage Dr. Lorry could not say enough,
was hurrying back towards the village, crying
like a child.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">GIVEN BACK</span></h2>

<p>Sydney seemed to herself to have a good
many odd dreams during that time of illness.</p>

<p>Strange faces looked out of a great darkness,
and pictures came and went like magic-lantern
slides. But one thing always stayed, and that
was fever.</p>

<p>Then there came a time when she seemed
to herself to be all alone in a dark place where
no one came to her, though she cried continually
for mother, and was certain that if
only this weight would leave her head, she
could lift it and call loud enough for mother
to hear her!</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, there was shaded
lamp-light in the rose bedroom, and mother
was sitting there beside her bed.</p>

<p>She tried to speak, but found the words
did not come; nor did a hand, that seemed
lying loosely on the counterpane belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to nobody, move from its place, but mother
took it in hers and kissed it. Sydney had
a vague kind of feeling that everything was
right now mother had come.</p>

<p>Then there was a time when things grew
clearer; when she knew that there was sometimes
daylight on the wall and sometimes lamp-light,
and then father was beside her, looking
at her through the gold-rimmed eye-glasses she
knew so well. And presently Mr. Seaton was
kneeling by her bed, saying words which she
was dimly conscious he had said before. Then
suddenly everything was quite clear, and a
mild spring-like air was coming in through
the open window, and she felt as if all the
dreams had passed away in that long night
of fever.</p>

<p>“I always said she would turn the corner
when Mrs. Chichester came!” Dr. Lorry
declared, rubbing his hands gleefully; and
though of course all credit should be given
to the doctors and the nurses, I think Mrs.
Chichester’s presence and her strong mother-love
had no small amount to do with calling
back the girl, whose feet had gone so very
near the margin of that river we call death.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester himself brought the news
that Sydney had turned the sharp corner and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
come back to those who loved her, to the
kinsman keeping his watch on the sofa in the
library, and I think any feelings of antagonism
towards the Chichesters that St. Quentin may
have had left, were quite swept away by the
look on the doctor’s face and the choke in his
voice as he said, “She has turned the corner
now—thank God for it!”</p>

<p>The marquess even went so far as to
remember Hugh and his feelings and, unconscious
of that watch the young man had
kept outside the Castle, desired that a servant
should instantly go down with a message to
the improvised hospital.</p>

<p>It was the next morning—a strange, disorganised
morning—when everybody seemed
to be united in the one absorbing gladness,
that St. Quentin asked to see the Vicar when
he came down from his visit to Sydney.</p>

<p>Mr. Seaton wondered at the summons, but
rejoiced over it with all his heart. It had been
one of his great griefs that he was allowed
to give no help or comfort to this man who
stood so plainly in need of both.</p>

<p>“So you’ve pulled your boy round?” was
St. Quentin’s greeting, as the Vicar came into
the library. “I can’t tell you how glad I am
of that—the jolly little chap! That will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
something to tell Sydney when she’s strong
enough to hear news.... That isn’t what
I want to say, though.” He stopped; then
brought the last words out with a rush: “Isn’t
there something you pray in churches when
you’ve something—very special—to be thankful
for?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Vicar, sympathising with the
effort in his tone—“there is a prayer of
thanksgiving for ‘great mercies vouchsafed’—that
is what you mean, I think?”</p>

<p>St. Quentin nodded. “I didn’t exactly
deserve mercy,” he said, “but I am thankful
for it! She’ll be a credit to the name, you
know.... Say the prayer for me, will you,
now? I can’t go to church, you see!”</p>

<p>And the Vicar, kneeling, thanked God for
more than His gift of life to the girl upstairs!</p>

<p>“Come and look me up again when you’ve
time, will you?” said the marquess, when Mr.
Seaton took his leave; and the Vicar said,
“I will,” with all his heart.</p>

<p>Sydney was very happy in her dainty rose-room,
with mother sitting by her bedside,
holding her hand: she was very happy when
carried to the sofa in the morning-room, where
mother read to her, or talked and worked.
“But I want to go downstairs and see St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Quentin,” she said, and Dr. Lorry was prevailed
upon to sanction the proceeding as soon
as it was at all safe.</p>

<p>Grand preparations were made downstairs
for the great event. Dickson worried St.
Quentin to the verge of distraction with his
repeated tidyings of the library, and would
have worried him into a very bad temper
if the preparations had been made on behalf of
anyone but Sydney.</p>

<p>A deputation arrived from the convalescent
village to know if anyone would be allowed
to see “our young lady,” and though Dr.
Lorry was obliged to decline such attentions
for his patient on her first appearance, the
deputation was dismissed with the assurance
that Miss Lisle would soon be out and among
them once more.</p>

<p>Dr. Chichester came down again for twenty-four
hours to see how “his little girl”
bore the move, and Sydney had another
visitor.</p>

<p>“I suppose she won’t be happy without the
paragon!” St. Quentin said to Dr. Lorry,
“so you’d better bring him up with you to tea.
But mind, he’s not to be up to any of his fool’s
tricks with her—talking as though they were
mere acquaintances, as he did when last they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
met. Tell him to be natural and brotherly, or
else to stop away!”</p>

<p>But Hugh came. Perhaps his manner was
not quite brotherly as he came forward to
arrange the sofa for the slight girl whom
his father carried in so easily, but Sydney
did not seem to find anything amiss
with it.</p>

<p>She lay smiling blissfully upon them all—father—mother—Hugh—St.
Quentin. “Oh,
Cousin St. Quentin, if only you could get well
I should be quite happy!” she said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT HUGH TOLD</span></h2>

<p>“Mr. Chichester to see you, my lord.”</p>

<p>St. Quentin and Sydney looked up; the
latter with a quick flush, which made her
prettier than ever, her cousin thought.</p>

<p>She was reading the paper to him, with a
praiseworthy effort, hitherto not crowned with
much success, to feel a keen interest in the
“Imperial Parliament.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Hugh,” St. Quentin said, with a
glance at Sydney. “I suppose he has run
down to see Lorry. Ask him to come in,
John.”</p>

<p>Hugh was looking rather excited, and his
voice could not repress a certain eagerness,
as he took the hand the marquess held out.
St. Quentin could not help liking the look
of the clean-cut, honest young face, with
straightforwardness and self-control in every
line of it.</p>

<p>“It’s a frightful pity he hasn’t ten thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
a year,” the marquess thought to himself,
watching the way Sydney’s eyes shone as
she greeted the young man. “If he had
anything respectable in the way of an income,
he should have the child, upon my word he
should! But a young doctor with no special
prospects!” and he shook his head.</p>

<p>“You wanted me, eh? Hope you left
the Doctor and Mrs. Chichester quite well?
Sydney, hadn’t you better get your ride
while the sun’s out? It’s a first-class morning,
and you’ll see Mr. Chichester at lunch,
you know, and get all your town news
then.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s eyes followed the graceful figure
from the room. He had not seen her before
in long dresses and with the hair coiled round
the shapely head. Though the presentation
had not taken place, partly owing to the illness,
and later to Sydney’s obstinate refusal to
leave the cousin to whom she was becoming
daily more necessary, even Lady Frederica
had seen the impossibility of keeping the child-Sydney
any longer.</p>

<p>They had grown used to the change at
the Castle, but Hugh saw her for the first
time with the unspeakable charm of sweet
young womanhood upon her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Quentin noted the direction of his eyes
and spoke.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for you, Hugh; indeed I am.
If things were different——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” poor Hugh burst out.
“You needn’t be afraid, Lord St. Quentin.
I know I’ve got to keep out of her way all
I can. You needn’t be afraid of my forgetting
that I never can be anything but her brother
Hugh—some one to stand by her if she should
need any one to do it, but never to presume
on that!”</p>

<p>He walked to the window, and stood staring
out at the fresh green of the Park and the
spring glory of the garden, all ablaze with
crocuses, in lilac, white, and gold.</p>

<p>“Well,” St. Quentin said, “I think the
child would have been a good deal happier
if circumstances hadn’t put her into this position.
But they have, and she will make a first-rate
Lady St. Quentin one of these days, I imagine,
though there’s no doubt she’ll spoil the tenants
shamefully, you Chichesters having taught her
to think of everyone except herself. You are
an unselfish family, and you’ve taught her
to be the same. I wish—I wish—you wanted
something I <em>could</em> give you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything except to see Sydney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
happy,” poor Hugh said, and then he came
and sat down by his host. “I’m forgetting
what I came about,” he said. “Will you
forgive me for touching on a subject which
must be rather painful to you?”</p>

<p>“The new cottages are all right, surely?”
cried St. Quentin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they are certain to be all right,”
Hugh said; “it isn’t that. There was a man
brought into the Blue-friars the other day,
frightfully hurt internally, and we thought it
was all up with him, or would be soon, at
least. Well, after a bit I was with him alone,
and saw he was in great distress of mind,
to add to his other troubles. I got presently
at what was wrong. He gathered that we
thought him in a very bad way, and had it
on his mind that he had once wronged a man
frightfully. I got the poor chap to make his
confession to me, and took it down, and he
signed it. His name is Duncombe.”</p>

<p>The colour rushed into St. Quentin’s pale
face.</p>

<p>“Go on!” he said, in a voice of strained
calm.</p>

<p>“His confession was this. He was riding
your horse, MacIvor, in a race against a certain
Sir Algernon Bridge and another man—I forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
his name—it didn’t signify. Duncombe
was in trouble of some kind and wanted money
over and above the pay you promised him for
riding. A letter from you, written just before
the race, promised him an extra fifty if he won
it. He went and injured in some way Sir
Algernon’s horse, Doll, the night before, but
being in a funk he overdid the business, and
the horse bowled over sooner than he meant
it to. There were enquiries, and Sir Algernon’s
jockey accused Duncombe. In his fright he
declared—forgive me, please—that he acted by
your orders, producing the letter you had
written him to prove his words. He was
awfully ashamed of that part of the business,
for of course he knew all along you only meant
fair play. But he said he had an old mother
who depended on him, and it wouldn’t mean
prison for a gentleman. I don’t believe he
understood it meant something infinitely worse.
Sir Algernon Bridge took the letter from him
and bribed him to say nothing more about it.
He was only too glad to hold his tongue at
first, for Sir Algernon assured him that he
was your friend, and intended to suppress the
letter for your sake, but later on he seems to
have had qualms at having acted unfairly by
you. He said he never meant to do you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wrong, for you had been extremely kind to
him. He seems to have guessed later that
Sir Algernon meant no good to you; for his
old mother lives at Loam, and comes to
Sydney’s work-parties. They kept him up
to some knowledge of your doings.... He
asked me to give you his confession, and
begged that you would make what use of it
you liked, and not consider him.”</p>

<p>St. Quentin took the paper from Hugh’s
hand and read it slowly. What would he not
have given for it long ago? Now he was
dying, and nothing seemed to matter very
much.</p>

<p>“May I tell the poor chap you forgive
him?” Hugh said.</p>

<p>“Is he still alive?” asked St. Quentin in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, and will live, I think. It’s a most
extraordinary case; quite unique in the annals
of the hospital, and we are awfully proud of
the operation which has saved him. His
injury had till now been considered hopeless,
but Sir Anthony is a genius, and he’s pulled
him through, we hope. I am going down the
village to tell Lorry of the case, if you don’t
want me any longer. He is so interested in
all fresh developments of science.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” St. Quentin said.
“Come back to luncheon, and tell that poor
fellow, when you see him next, that it’s—all
right.”</p>

<p>Hugh went through the Park and down the
village, where cottages of a greatly improved
kind were rising rapidly in place of the old
ones. The thinning trees of the Park told
at what cost this long-neglected duty was
performed.</p>

<p>He soon reached the charming, roomy redbrick
Queen Anne house where Dr. Lorry
lived, and was receiving the heartiest of
welcomes from his old friend in the quaint,
dark, comfortable dining-room.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, this is capital!—capital, I
say! I am quite delighted. You must put
in a few days with me now you’re here, for
all your patients will be clamouring to see you.
I get nothing but enquiries after ‘Dr. Hugh.’
You’ve quite taken the wind out of my sails
here, I can tell you, and that little rascal
Pauly—‘I want Dr. Hugh,’ he cries, whenever
I go up to physic him!”</p>

<p>“I see you are still a famous story-teller,
sir,” Hugh said, laughing.</p>

<p>“Ah! in my anecdotage,” chuckled the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
doctor. “A friend I hadn’t seen for thirty
years came home the other day from Africa,
and looked me up. ‘Why, you hardly look
a day older, Lorry!’ he said, ‘and I quite
expected to find you in your dotage!’”</p>

<p>“‘The stage before it—<em>anecdotage</em>, Tom!’”
I said. “I thought he would have died!”</p>

<p>“A good many stages still before it, <em>I</em> take
leave to think!” Hugh said.</p>

<p>“No, no. I’m getting old, my boy, and
thinking of retiring,” said the doctor. “Little
Pauly isn’t far wrong when he cries out for
a younger man!”</p>

<p>“I hope the little chap is all right again?”
asked Hugh.</p>

<p>“I should just about think so, and more
rampagious than ever. Father can’t let him
out of his sight, you know, but I don’t think
he altogether spoils him. Miss Lisle and Miss
Osric do that. By the way, though it’s not
announced yet, I think we may feel pretty
sure the Vicar won’t let Miss Osric leave
Lislehurst when Miss Lisle dispenses with a
governess.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Hugh said, looking pleased.
“I’m very glad. Sydney thinks no end of
Miss Osric, I know, and the Vicar is a downright
brick. And Pauly wants a mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he won’t get so many chances of
tumbling off church towers or catching fevers
then,” the doctor said. “It will be a fine
thing for the little monkey in every way.
And I agree with you about Miss Osric: she’s
a very nice girl, a very nice girl indeed. But
Master Pauly has to do the courting for his
father now, for the Vicar and Lord St. Quentin
have struck up quite a friendship; that’s a
new departure, isn’t it? It’s very good for
St. Quentin! Well, and what news have
you brought me down from town, my dear
boy? Anything fresh on the placards this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Only a big jewel robbery,” Hugh said,
laughing. “I really came to see Lord St.
Quentin on a bit of business concerning him
that I chanced to come across. And, while
I was here, I thought I would give myself
the pleasure of looking you up, and telling
you of our last triumph at the Blue-friars.
A really remarkable case: I’m sure you will
be interested.”</p>

<p>Hugh was right in his conviction, but even
he had not expected such a violent interest
as his old friend displayed.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry leaned forward, putting quick,
sharp questions as to the exact nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
injury which had been operated on so successfully,
and finally, as Hugh concluded, seized
the young man’s hand and nearly wrung it
off his wrist.</p>

<p>“Thank God! thank God!” he cried. “It
has saved one man; it can save another!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Hugh cried. The
old man’s intense excitement was infectious.</p>

<p>Dr. Lorry stood up, trembling with eagerness.
“Lord St. Quentin’s injury is <em>the same
as that which you have been describing</em>,” he
said. “If your Sir Anthony has saved this
Duncombe, we must have him down to save
St. Quentin!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAITING OF TWO</span></h2>

<p>A week later, and Sydney was at the Deanery
again.</p>

<p>Hugh’s hero, the great surgeon who gave
his services to the Blue-friars Hospital, had
come down to see St. Quentin, and perform on
him the operation which had saved the life of
the man Duncombe.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Lady Frederica
declined absolutely remaining at the Castle.</p>

<p>“My nerves really wouldn’t stand it,” she
explained. “I hate anything to do with illness,
but hitherto St. Quentin’s has been kept comparatively
in the background: in fact, it has
been possible to forget it. But an operation—with
doctors and nurses hovering round—and
bulletins upon the door, and people expecting
one to have a full, true, and particular
account of how the patient is at one’s finger’s
ends! No, thank you. I shall go to town,
and Sydney shall come with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>But Sydney rebelled, and appealed against
the verdict to her cousin.</p>

<p>“If I must go away, let me go to the
Deanery!” she implored. “I can’t go with
Lady Frederica! I must go to somebody who
cares too!”</p>

<p>A flush swept over St. Quentin’s face.</p>

<p>“Who cares too?” he muttered, then with
an effort turned to her and spoke aloud.</p>

<p>“Sydney, I’ll tell you this. If, in God’s
mercy, I get through the operation, I am going
to follow your advice, and tell the girl I love
just everything, as I told you.”</p>

<p>Sydney got her way, and went to the Deanery,
accompanied by Miss Osric, leaving Lady
Frederica to go off to town alone.</p>

<p>The third day of her absence from the Castle
had come—a long dreary day, which seemed
unending. It was to relieve the strain of that
waiting time that Katharine suggested, when
the shadows were falling long about the Close,
that they should go across to Oliver’s, to
choose a gold chain as a birthday present for
the little cousin Sylvia, whose birthday was to
be on the morrow.</p>

<p>Action of any kind was something of a
comfort, and Sydney came.</p>

<p>A shabbily-dressed man was just concluding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
some bargain with the jeweller as the
two girls came into the shop—some bargain
with which he seemed very much dissatisfied.
“It’s worth <em>ever</em> so much more, confound you
for a screw!” they heard him say. “Why,
that’s two quid less than you gave the parson
for it. I only brought it here because I
thought you’d give a better price for your own
thing.”</p>

<p>Sydney started violently, for the voice was
Sir Algernon’s, and on the counter between
him and Oliver there lay her little watch.</p>

<p>Katharine had recognised him also, and her
eyes flashed. “Come away, Sydney dear,”
she said.</p>

<p>Low as she spoke, he caught the words
and turned. But for his voice, Sydney hardly
would have known him.</p>

<p>The light of a pale spring evening fell
upon his face through the open doorway of
the jeweller’s shop, and showed up pitilessly
the wreck he had made of it. His eyes were
bloodshot and furtive, and the lines had
deepened round them, while his hair showed
very grey above the ears. He looked to-day
far older than his forty-one years warranted.</p>

<p>He made an uncertain movement forward.
Katharine drew away: “Come, Sydney!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>They left the shop, but, once outside, the
younger girl paused, looking back.</p>

<p>Sir Algernon had followed them into the
street, and was gazing after them as though he
wished to speak. Sydney noted the shabbiness
of his dress and the fact that he had not shaved
that morning.</p>

<p>“Katharine,” she said, “won’t you hear
what he has to say?”</p>

<p>He heard her and came forward. The hand
with which he lifted his hat shook. Katharine
drew herself away from him, but Sydney stood
her ground.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said, “I only want you
to give Quin a message from me. He wrote
to me, you know, to tell me that he had
Duncombe’s written confession of the part
I’d played after that miserable race, but didn’t
mean to publish it, or show me up. He’s
treating me a long way better than I treated
him. I want you to tell him that, if you
will, and also tell him that he won’t be bothered
by me any more. That evening I left St.
Quentin Castle I had had a wire to tell me that
I was practically ruined. The man of business
to whom I had pinned my faith—as far as I
ever pinned it upon anybody—had taken a leaf
out of my book, and gone in for gambling—speculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
rather. When he’d finished his
own money he used mine, relying on the
fact that I was too busy screwing poor old
Quin to attend to my own affairs. Of course
he thought he’d get it back; they always do!
But he didn’t, and the shock killed him. That
was what the wire told me, and it was that
that made me so hard on Quin. To make him
pay up then was my last chance, you see; but
you baulked that! You won the game, and
I drop it for the future. I’m going abroad
somewhere now; tell Quin he’s done with
me for good and all, and I have sold the
watch I bought for you to pay my passage
out. Good-bye, Miss Lisle.”</p>

<p>“I will tell St. Quentin,” Sydney answered
gravely, holding out her hand. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Sir Algernon took the little hand.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he said again, then added, as
though half against his will, “After all, I’m
not particularly sorry that you won the game.”</p>

<p>He walked off quickly in the opposite
direction, and passed from Sydney’s life as
suddenly as he had entered it.</p>

<p>“I hope you did not mind my speaking to
him, Katharine,” she said, as the two went
through the cool, green, peaceful Close together.
“I could not have done it, if—if—he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
not been so shabby. But I think if—<em>when</em> he
gets well, and we tell him, that St. Quentin
will be glad.”</p>

<p>“I believe you were right,” Katharine said
quietly, and the two passed into the Deanery
together.</p>

<p>A great hush seemed upon everything, and
as the girls sat in the deep window of the
drawing-room when dinner was over, the whole
world seemed to wear a look of listening. It
was one of those wonderfully mild spring
evenings which March sometimes gives us as
a foretaste of the summer that is coming.
Katharine let the fire burn low, and did not
close the window.</p>

<p>There was no breeze to stir the daffodils
and tulips, which had lost their colour in the
fading of the light: across the Close the grey
Cathedral stood silent and solemn, looking
down with grave, infinite pity upon the fleeting
troubles and anxieties of the people living
their little lives around its walls.</p>

<p>To and fro across the shadowy turf the
Dean walked, with his hands behind him, deep
in thought. The soft, sweet-scented spring
darkness had fallen, but Katharine would not
ring for lights. The girls sat quietly together,
their hands clasped in the dimness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Into the silence came the mellow chime of
the cathedral clock: the four quarters, which
had passed while they were sitting there,
pealed out one after another, and then the
nine deep strokes of the hour.</p>

<p>“There must be news of some kind by
now,” Sydney cried.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see her companion’s face,
and Katharine did not answer her.</p>

<p>Hard upon her words there came a sound
of quick, sharp footsteps ringing out upon the
flagged path running through the Close. The
Dean raised his head and stood still.</p>

<p>“Canon Molyneux returning,” Katharine
said, but she rose, with a strained expectancy
in her position.</p>

<p>The steps came nearer. Sydney darted down
the stairs, and was flinging back the heavy
front door in a moment. “Hugh!”</p>

<p>“Sir Anthony thinks he is going to pull
round!” was all Hugh said.</p>

<p>Katharine had followed Sydney to the hall,
but when a moment later the girl looked round
for her, she had gone.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE DEANERY GARDEN</span></h2>

<p>Katharine Morrell sat in a sheltered nook
in the Deanery garden, all flooded with the
mellow sunshine of an April afternoon.</p>

<p>The trim, box-edged garden beds were gay
with spring flowers, and the air was full of
the song of birds and of the faint, sweet, sleepy
scent of the poplar.</p>

<p>Before her the great grey cathedral reared
its mighty pile against a sky of pale, pure
blue, relieved by clouds of fleecy whiteness.
Pigeons were sunning themselves here and
there on some projecting buttress, or in some
quaintly-carved niche. The whole world
seemed full of peace and hope and life renewed.</p>

<p>Katharine’s hat was on the grass beside
her, and the soft spring breeze lightly stirred
the fair hair on her smooth, white brow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
brought a touch of pure rose colour to her
fair face.</p>

<p>On her knee there lay an opened letter in
Sydney’s hand-writing. She took it up and
read the last page through again.</p>

<p>“It is so good to see St. Quentin walk
across the room, even though still leaning
on a stick. Dr. Lorry says he is making a
most marvellous recovery, and Sir Anthony,
who has been down to the Castle twice since
the operation, is delighted with him. Sir
Anthony said several <em>ever</em> such nice things
about Hugh; I wish father could have heard
him. He would have been so pleased.</p>

<p>“St. Quentin actually went yesterday to see
that poor man Duncombe, who has come
down here to live with his mother. He is
to do light work in the gardens as soon as
he is strong enough. He was so pleased to
see St. Quentin, and he could not say enough
about Hugh’s kindness to him while he was
at the Blue-friars Hospital. He seems a
nice man, and is terribly sorry for all the
harm which he has done St. Quentin, though
St. Quentin tells him ‘not to think about it
any more.’</p>

<p>“This morning we have been to call upon
the Vicar. St. Quentin walked all round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Vicarage garden to look at Mr. Seaton’s
hyacinths, and was not over-tired. Doesn’t
that sound like being really better?</p>

<p>“He talks of driving in to Donisbro’ to
thank the Dean for his kind enquiries.”</p>

<p>It was this last sentence that Katharine
read again and again, with a light in her
eyes and a flush upon her cheek.</p>

<p>“He talks of driving in to Donisbro’ to
thank the Dean for his kind enquiries.”</p>

<p>Bees hummed in and out among the flowers,
with their peculiar sound of infinite contentment;
along the sunny borders the yellow
heads of the daffodils were nodding gently
in the breeze. Katharine thought she had
never known the garden look so lovely—never
since that spring day nine long years
ago, when her father brought Lord Lisle, as
St. Quentin had been called then, into it for
the first time.</p>

<p>Nine years—was it really nine years since
that April afternoon when she had gone out
to gather daffodils to fill the vases in the
drawing-room?</p>

<p>She was eighteen then, and dressed in a
gown of pale green, she remembered. Her
father had a fancy for green and loved to see
her in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>She remembered how the tall young man
at the Dean’s side had looked at that young
Katharine of nine years ago, and how presently
they were walking side by side along the
straight flagged garden paths, he carrying
her bunch of daffodils.</p>

<p>What had they said? Nothing very much,
she fancied. They talked about the flowers,
and he spoke of his mother’s famous orchids
at St. Quentin Castle, and said how much
he should like the Dean and Miss Morrell
to see them.</p>

<p>Nine years ago; but she could recall every
line of the tall young figure, with handsome
head erect, and eyes that said so much. She
could even bring back to her memory the
very look of the strong, shapely hand that
held the daffodils—her daffodils.</p>

<p>Had not daffodils been the flowers she
loved best ever since—yes, ever since! though
she had tried to think she hated them upon
a certain day five years ago when she had
burnt a little dried-up bunch of them which
for four years had lain among her treasures.</p>

<p>Had a spring and daffodil time ever come
and gone through all these nine years that
she had not thought of the tall figure and
the handsome face, and of the grey eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
that looked at her more often than the flowers
he had come to see?</p>

<p>A rather faltering step was upon the flagged
path skirting the close-shaven lawn. Katharine
looked up.</p>

<p>He was there before her, the man of whom
she had been thinking—the same, yet not the
same. There was little to remind her of the
gay young lover of nine years ago, except
the eyes, which looked forth from the worn
face with the old expression in them—the
old expression she remembered so well, only
deepened and intensified.</p>

<p>“Katharine!” said Lord St. Quentin.</p>

<p>She was at his side in a moment. “You
should not be standing! Take my arm. Here
is an easy chair for you.”</p>

<p>He sank into the chair she had drawn
forward; she sat down quietly at his side.</p>

<p>Around them hyacinths were springing
everywhere about the grass—it was a fancy
of the Dean’s to grow them so, instead of in
the garden beds. The air seemed filled with
their rare fragrance.</p>

<p>Under the grey line of the old Deanery
ran a border bright with golden daffodils.</p>

<p>“You stood there when I saw you first,”
St. Quentin said. “You were outlined against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the grey wall in your pale green gown, and
you held a bunch of daffodils in one hand.
You wore no hat, and the breeze was stirring
your hair on your temples as it is to-day.”</p>

<p>She put her hand to her head with a nervous
gesture quite unusual with her.</p>

<p>“Nine years ago,” she said. “I have
changed.”</p>

<p>“And I have changed more,” he answered
gravely. “Katharine, look at me.”</p>

<p>She looked as he bade, almost timidly, at
the thin earnest face beside her.</p>

<p>“You know—you <em>must</em> know why it is I
have come here to you to-day,” he said, his
voice vibrating strangely. “Katharine! I
have no right to ask or expect that you can
care for me still. And I am not here to offer
you my love; I gave it to you nine long years
ago, and you have had it ever since. I have
come to make you a confession.”</p>

<p>He told the story of his selfishness and
folly—hiding nothing. She listened silently,
her head bent, her hands clasped on her
knee.</p>

<p>“I have no right to offer you what’s left
from the wreck I’ve made of my life,” he
concluded, “but my love is yours—as it always
has been since that first spring afternoon I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
saw you, as it always must be through life
and beyond it.”</p>

<p>He rose slowly from his chair, leaning upon
his stick.</p>

<p>“Thank you for listening to me, dear.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She came swiftly towards him, and laid her
two hands upon his arm.</p>

<p>“You have no faith,” she said, “though
perhaps I hardly deserve that you should
believe in my love after that cruel letter that I
wrote five years ago. St. Quentin, don’t you
know that I have cared always?—that I cared
even when I told you that I never wished to see
or hear of you again? It is not possible to give
up caring, and, dear, I care more, far more now,
than ever I cared in that bright spring time
long ago. Dear, don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>And St. Quentin did.</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve it,” he said hoarsely, “but
please God you sha’n’t regret your trust and
your forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“We both have something to forgive,” she
said; and then he caught her to him with a
murmured, “My darling! my darling!” and
there fell a silence on the two in the flower-filled
garden, flooded with the mellow sunshine
of that April afternoon. And overhead a full-throated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
thrush broke into its liquid song—a
song which was so wonderfully full of gladness
that it almost seemed as though it spoke
the words of thankfulness to which they could
not give voice.</p>

<p>The silver-haired Dean found the two among
the hyacinths, when he came down the paved
walk an hour later, and was filled at once
with kindly solicitude upon his guest’s behalf.</p>

<p>“My dear St. Quentin, it is most delightful
to see you on your feet again; but, my dear
boy, what rashness to come all the way to
Donisbro’ so soon! What was your doctor
thinking of? What could possess you to do
anything so foolish?”</p>

<p>The Marquess wondered vaguely what <em>had</em>
been the reason he had given to himself and
others for his visit to Donisbro’. Katharine,
with a little gleam of laughter in her clear
eyes, came to his assistance.</p>

<p>“St. Quentin came to return thanks in
person for your kind enquiries, father,” she
said, taking the old man’s hands in both hers.
“That was so, wasn’t it, St. Quentin? And
while he was here he thought he had better
tell me something as well.”</p>

<p>A smile of understanding broke out upon
the Dean’s benevolent old face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you forgive me, sir, and trust her
with me?” said St. Quentin, holding out his
hand. “I am not worthy of her, but with
God’s help I’ll try to do my best to be so,
and to make her happy. Will you give her
to me?”</p>

<p>The old man’s warm handclasp was sufficient
answer, and made the hearty words,
“With all my heart,” unnecessary. And he
added, as he drew his daughter to him, kissing
her upon the forehead, “I am not afraid to
trust her to you <em>now</em>, St. Quentin.”</p>

<p>“Please God, you shan’t regret it, sir,” St.
Quentin said, as he had said before to
Katharine, and the three went toward the
Deanery together along the path beside the
daffodil-filled border.</p>

<p>“It was little Sydney who sent me here
to-day,” St. Quentin said to Katharine, as
they stood a moment just inside the low-browed,
quaintly-carved stone porch of the old Deanery,
looking back on what must be to them for
evermore an enchanted garden; “it was she
whose faith in love’s endurance sent me here
to-day to test it, Katharine. God bless the
child for that, and for all!”</p>

<p>And Katharine echoed from her heart, “Yes,
God bless her!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="smaller">A HOME-COMING</span></h2>

<p>“’Tis May without and May within!” might
well have been Sydney’s song, as she literally
danced along the Park on a perfect afternoon
a few weeks later.</p>

<p>Though she and Miss Osric had been up
since seven o’clock, the day had seemed all
too short for everything she wanted to crowd
into it.</p>

<p>“No one should do the flowers but herself,”
she declared, and Mackintosh groaned over
the ravages she made in “his conservatories”
and “his gardens.” But Miss Lisle was a
privileged person in his eyes, so his groans
were only inward, and he actually went so
far as to walk round the conservatories with
her, cutting what she wanted, with the face
of a martyr at the stake!</p>

<p>“Not that I grudge flowers in reason to
her ladyship,” he explained, “but what’s to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
become of my flower-show next month, miss,
I ask you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I won’t take all your flowers,” said
Sydney; “but surely, Mackintosh, you want
the Castle to be gay as much as I do when
Lord St. Quentin is bringing home his bride
at last!”</p>

<p>“Well, miss, I’ll not say but that I do
rejoice with all my heart,” the old man said.
“And a fine upstanding ladyship we shall
have, says I! I mind her well enough when
she come here first with the Dean, and looked
at my flowers for all the world as if they were
Christians, and understood what she said to
’em. ‘Oh, you beauties! you lovely things!’
she cried as she comes into the conservatories,
as his lordship he was showing to her. No,
miss, I don’t grudge my flowers, in reason—not
to you or to her ladyship!”</p>

<p>The wedding had taken place very quietly
a fortnight ago. Both Katharine and St.
Quentin felt that they had waited long enough
for the happiness that had so nearly never
come at all. They were married early one
morning, in one of the little side chapels of
the great cathedral, by Katharine’s white-haired
father, with only Sydney and the little
cousin Sylvia present, and old Dr. Lorry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
who insisted upon coming, to see how his
patient got through the ceremony. There
were so few relations upon either side to
come, even if the health of the bridegroom
had been fit for anything but the quietest of
weddings. St. Quentin asked Lady Frederica
to be present from a sense of duty, but was
neither surprised nor disappointed when she
wrote to explain it was impossible to expect
her to attend a wedding which was fixed for
so unconscionably early an hour, but she sent
her best wishes to them both. She also sent
a handsome wedding present, for which the
bill came in afterwards to St. Quentin. So
there were only those few there to hear the
words that made Katharine and St. Quentin
man and wife at last. The honeymoon had
been passed in a health-giving cruise on the
Mediterranean, and now they were to come
home.</p>

<p>Lady Frederica had never returned to the
Castle after St. Quentin’s operation, and it
cannot be said that her nephew missed her.
He invited Mrs. Chichester to come and stay
with Sydney during the period of his convalescence,
and inwardly determined, as he saw
the delight with which the girl showed all her
favourite haunts to “mother,” that she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
have at least the female portion of the house
of Chichester to stay with her as often as she
liked. In fact, Katharine had already expressed
her intention of being great friends with them
all.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Chichester had gone back to
London now, and for the fortnight of the
honeymoon Miss Osric and Sydney had been
alone, and had certainly made good use of
their time in the business of arranging a
welcome for St. Quentin and his bride.</p>

<p>The Castle was ablaze with flowers and
the air ablaze with sunshine, as Sydney, her
labours finished, but too excited to sit still and
wait, went dancing onward through the Park
and out into the village, where the hedges
were fast breaking into the bridal white of
hawthorn blossom. Miss Osric, as soon as
all the work was finished, had discreetly betaken
herself to the Vicarage, leaving the girl
to welcome Katharine and her cousin alone.</p>

<p>It was four o’clock: they would hardly be
here for another quarter of an hour, Sydney
thought to herself, and she slackened her
pace and looked upward at the gorgeous
decorations with which the little village was
aflame.</p>

<p>The children were all drawn up in a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
on the village green, under the charge of the
schoolmistress, and armed with little, tight,
hard bunches of flowers, to cast before the
happy pair. Most of the tenantry, the farmers
on horseback, were waiting at the top of the
village at the turning on the Dacreshaw road.
Some few of the women, however, were remaining
quietly at the cottage doors, satisfied
without that first view of the bride and bridegroom
which the others seemed to think so
desirable.</p>

<p>Among the number of these last was Mrs.
Sawyer, who, with a healthy colour in the
face that used to look so sickly, was standing
smiling at the neat white gate of her new
cottage.</p>

<p>Sydney paused to shake hands with her
and ask if everything in the new cottage were
entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Why, that it is, miss,” was the hearty
response, “if it weren’t for just a little leakage
in the boiler. But there, miss, I’ve no call
to complain, for indeed I scarcely know myself
with my beautiful tiled kitchen, as is almost
too good to use, and my back-kitchen as is
fit for duchesses to work in, and all the rest
as ’is lordship ’as done for me. Reckon that
there boiler is my crumpled rose-leaf, miss!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Sawyer was so serious that Sydney
felt it would not do to laugh, though the
description of the large black boiler as “a
rose-leaf” made the corners of the mouth
twitch ominously.</p>

<p>She volunteered to come and look at it,
and was bending down to examine the
defective tap, when a roar of distant cheering
made both forget the leaking boiler and rush
wildly to the door. “They are coming!”</p>

<p>Round the bend in the road, under the great
arch wreathed with flowers and bearing the
inscription, “Welcome to the bride and bridegroom,”
bowled the carriage. There they were!</p>

<p>St. Quentin, still very thin, but upright, hat
in hand, smiling and nodding to his tenants
as they roared their welcome, and by his side
Katharine, fair and stately, unchanged, except
that the sadness had passed from her eyes.</p>

<p>Sydney ran forward, and the carriage
stopped.</p>

<p>“Hullo! what are you doing wandering
about alone?” St. Quentin asked, laughing,
when they had exchanged greetings. “Lucky
for you Aunt Rica isn’t here! What is it?”</p>

<p>“I am trying to make out what is wrong
with Mrs. Sawyer’s boiler,” she explained; “it
leaks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The marquess said something in a low tone
to his wife, jumped down, handed her from the
carriage, and turned to Greaves, wooden with
surprise upon the box, at this extraordinary
conduct on the part of the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>“Drive on, Greaves; we’ll walk up presently.
Now, Mrs. Sawyer, let’s have a look at the
boiler.”</p>

<p>“You could have knocked me down with
a feather!” Mrs. Sawyer was wont to say
when dilating on the story afterwards. “For
in they all come, as sure as I’m a living
woman! and down goes his lordship on his
knees, as interested in that boiler as if it was
a newspaper full of the quarrellings of that
there silly Parliament, and turns the tap about,
and then jumps up and looks about to see
if the workmen had left any putty, and as
pleased as may be when he finds it, and
down on his knees again—and thankful I was
as I’d scrubbed the floor only that morning—and
makes as neat a job of it as may be, just
to last till the plumber comes to do it proper, he
says; and full of jokes all the time he was,
as made me laugh till I cried nearly!</p>

<p>“And her ladyship sitting by, in my best
chair, and nursing Liza’s baby, as though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
fair loved to have it on her knee; and our
young lady, bless her! looking as bright and
happy as though her world was just made
of spring and sunshine, as I hopes it
may be!</p>

<p>“And his lordship made a rare good job of
the boiler too,” she would add, as though
anybody had presumed to doubt his powers as
a plumber, “and washed his hands in the
back kitchen when he finished, and dried ’em
on the round towel, not a bit proud, and when
he knocks his ’ead against the lintel going out,
he laughs again, and says, says he—‘Fane
must make my tenants’ doors a little higher,’
says he, ‘for I mean there to be room for
me to come in,’ he says.”</p>

<p>The three walked together through the
Park with the late afternoon sunshine glittering
on the glory of fresh green beneath and
overhead, and up the marble steps to the
splendid castle towering above them.</p>

<p>As they reached the top, St. Quentin raised
his hat, and took a hand of each.</p>

<p>“Welcome home!” he said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">DESDICHADO</span></h2>

<p>It was a brilliant June morning rather more
than a year after the events mentioned in
the last chapter.</p>

<p>The air was full of the song of birds and
the hum of bees, and of another sound to
which Sydney Lisle was listening, as she
stood upon the steps of the Castle, shading
eyes that danced joyfully from the dazzling
sunshine, and listening to the pealing of the
bells.</p>

<p>They were plain enough from Lislehurst
Church across the Park, but she could distinguish,
mingling with these, the more distant
peal from Loam, and even, she thought,
Marston’s little tinkling duet from its two
cracked bells, which were being pulled with
a goodwill that went far to atone for their
lack of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The glory of “leafy June,” that queen of
months, was upon the tall trees of the Park,
among which presently the girl went wandering.
How wonderful a world it was to-day!
She felt as though she wanted to drink in the
beauty around her.</p>

<p>The sunshine came flickering through the
trees, making a chequer of light and shade
upon the grassy path before her; in front the
softly dappled deer were feeding peacefully,
undisturbed by her approach.</p>

<p>“Pang—pang—pang—pang—pang—pang—pang—pang!”
went the bells, and Sydney
smiled in sympathy with that wonderful abandonment
of joy which only bells can give.</p>

<p>The girl made a charming picture as she
stood there on the soft grass, with the mighty
trees she loved so well towering in their
grandeur overhead, and the sunshine flickering
through the leaves upon her white gown and
sweet face.</p>

<p>She was good to look upon indeed in her
dainty gown, with a great bunch of yellow
roses at her belt, and that flush upon her cheek
and sun of gladness in her eyes. She might
have stood for an embodiment of the sweet
young summer which was making the world
good to dwell in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>So at least thought a young man, who, catching
through the trees a glimpse of her white
dress, had left the road and cut across the
Park toward her. As he came near his eyes
were fixed upon her earnest face, raised to the
glory of sight and sound above. She did not
hear his footsteps till he was quite close to her;
then she sprang to meet him with a low cry
of delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hugh! have you heard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard at Donisbro’ and came
straight.”</p>

<p>Something new in his voice brought a sudden
flush to the delicately tinted face. Her eyes
fell before his eager ones.</p>

<p>“Come into the gardens,” she said, turning,
and the two went wandering together in a
strange silence over the cool turf of the bowling
green where King Charles I. had once played
at his favourite game with a loyal Lisle of
old, a Sydney too.</p>

<p>The balmy, fragrant air was filled with the
clang of bells; beyond the Park they were
beginning to cut hay in the long meadows
sloping upwards towards the grey-green downs.
A great bush, covered with the little yellow
roses Sydney wore, smiled up at the two
who stood before it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pang—pang-pang-pang—pang—pang-pang-pang!”
went the bells.</p>

<p>“They ring with goodwill,” Hugh said, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“They are very glad,” said Sydney, “and
oh, Hugh, I wonder whether anybody on the
whole estate is more glad than I am!”</p>

<p>And then Hugh turned and caught her hands
and said, with an odd break in his voice,
“Syd, are you really?”</p>

<p>She looked straight up at him, and he
knew that she had spoken truth.</p>

<p>“If you are, what must I be!” he cried.
“My darling, you don’t know, you can’t
know what this means to me!”</p>

<p>His voice broke suddenly.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said. But I think she understood
without telling.</p>

<p>Later, as the two sat together on the grassy
bank bordering the bowling green, the girl
said, “Do you know, I think we ought to
be grateful to St. Quentin for taking me away
from home and all of you. It was very, very
hard to give up my brother Hugh, but this
is better!”</p>

<p>“It is,” Hugh said, with absolute conviction.</p>

<p>“Pang—pang-pang-pang—pang-pang-pang-pang!”
went the bells, tripping one another up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in their haste to clang out the glad tidings of
the birth of an heir male to the great St.
Quentin title and estates.</p>

<p>But Sydney had come, in those few quiet
minutes in the garden, into a far greater
heritage than that of which the little heir’s birth
had deprived her!</p>

<p>A tall figure with brown hair touched with
grey about the temples was coming down the
path towards the bowling green. Sydney
sprang to her feet and went to meet him, Hugh
following her closely.</p>

<p>Lord St. Quentin too was listening to the
bells, with a smile upon the face that had
nearly lost its cynical expression. “But I
feel almost as if the little beggar were doing
you an injury, Sydney,” he said, laying his
hand upon the girl’s slight shoulder as she
joined him.</p>

<p>“You are not to say that!” she cried.
“Do you think there is any one more glad and
happy than I am to-day? Oh, St. Quentin,
if you only knew how glad I am to be disinherited!”</p>

<p>He looked down at her glowing face, then
turned from hers to Hugh’s. The light of
comprehension dawned in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” he exclaimed as sternly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
as he could. “What mischief have you two
been doing now?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Sydney said audaciously, looking
up into his face, that she had grown so fond
of, “you see, you forbade me to look upon
Hugh as a brother any longer—and—and I
always try to obey you.”</p>

<p>“When I heard at Donisbro’ this morning
that she was safely out of the succession, I
couldn’t wait,” Hugh said. “There was just
time to catch the next train, and I caught it!”</p>

<p>The corners of St. Quentin’s mouth twitched,
and after one or two attempts to look serious,
he gave it up and laughed outright.</p>

<p>“You are a nice pair!” he said. “If it
weren’t for the fact that Katharine is sure to
be upon the side of true love, and that you,
Sydney, always insist upon your own way, I’d
play the stern guardian, and send Master Hugh
to the right-about!”</p>

<p>“But of course you are not going to do
anything so absolutely horrid,” Sydney said
with confidence. “You’re going to take him in
to see the baby.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the baby’s fault,” grumbled its
father, when Hugh had been presented to the
red-faced, crumpled, kicking object who was
Lord Lisle. “I believe I bear him a grudge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
You would have made a first-rate landlord,
Sydney!”</p>

<p>“I never should have made a marchioness,”
she declared with much decision. “Ask Lady
Frederica. And oh, Quin, don’t be cross, but
be glad that I haven’t got to try!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>Katharine sided with the lovers, as her
husband had foretold, and he withdrew his
opposition.</p>

<p>“Only, how do you intend to live?” he
enquired one day of Sydney, as she sat nursing
the little heir upon her knee.</p>

<p>“We are going to wait, of course,” she explained,
“till Hugh is earning rather more,
and in the meantime I am going to be so busy.
I shall learn cooking and housekeeping and
everything useful I can think of, and then it
won’t matter if Hugh and I are not so very
rich at first, will it?”</p>

<p>“H—m,” said St. Quentin. “You’re right
about not being in a hurry. Katharine and
I can’t do without you yet. But, you ridiculous
little goose! has it never struck you that there
are such things as wedding presents—and as
marriage settlements? Look here, old Lorry
wants to retire, if he can get a good offer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
his practice. It’s a first-rate one, you know,
and it appears your Hugh won golden opinions
here at the time of the fever. Lorry thinks
if he were to come down and work in with
him a little, the youngster would be received
with enthusiasm by the patients when he
himself cuts the concern. If your Hugh likes
the notion, I’ll buy the practice for him and
set you up in Lorry’s house, which you can
have rent free, of course. How would that
suit you as a wedding present? You see, old
Lorry means to retire on Donisbro’, where
some of his own people hang out.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice enough house and handy to
the Castle, which is fortunate; for even if
Katharine and I would allow you to leave
Lislehurst, my tenants wouldn’t. So if this
plan suits you and your Hugh, you can go on
with your work-parties and soup-kitchens and
all the rest of it, and you and Katharine together
see what you can do towards turning me into
a model landlord. What do you say to that
scheme, eh?”</p>

<p>“Hugh come here, and he and I live here
for always!” Sydney cried. “Oh, St. Quentin,
you don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“Then you like the notion?” said her cousin
with a pleased smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“Like it!” cried Sydney. “Why, the part
of being married that I minded was the leaving
you!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lord Lisle entertained quite a large party at
his christening feast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chichester was there, seeming to grow
visibly younger in the freedom from household
cares, and rapidly finding a congenial spirit in
Katharine, and Dolly, very happy to be with
Sydney again, and Fred and Prissie, who in
spite of some natural disappointment at finding
no merry-go-rounds in St. Quentin’s Park,
managed to enjoy themselves exceedingly, with
the ecstatic joy of London children in the
country.</p>

<p>And Lord Braemuir was there, burly and
good-natured as ever, and most hearty in his congratulations
both to Hugh and St. Quentin, and
Mr. Fenton, absolutely beaming, and looking
with a nervous interest at the baby, whom he
liked very much, he explained, “at a distance.”</p>

<p>And Hugh was there, with Dr. Lorry,
whose door already bore the brass inscription,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Gustavus Lorry.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Dr. Hugh Chichester.</span></p>

<p>And Mr. Seaton was there, looking as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
though all his cares had rolled away with the
coming of the bright-faced bride on his arm,
who made all the better housekeeper, he used
to say proudly, for knowing as much Greek
as he did himself.</p>

<p>And Pauly was there, but in no very sociable
frame of mind, for he ignored everyone but
Freddie, the length of whose nine-year-old
legs filled him with awe and admiration. He
refused to even look at the baby, but kept
his round eyes fixed on Freddie, who patronised
him in a way that amused the looker-on
considerably.</p>

<p>Both boys, however, managed to do full
justice to the splendid christening cake, on
which Mrs. Fewkes had expended her utmost
pains and skill. Indeed, Pauly very decidedly
made up for his abstinence upon that celebrated
fifth birthday.</p>

<p>And old Mr. Hudder was there, rather prosy
but extremely happy, and never more so than
when St. Quentin asked his “oldest tenant”
to propose the health of the son and heir.</p>

<p>“My Lord, Your Ladyship, and Ladies and
Gentlemen,” he said, “man and boy I’ve
held my farm under the Marquesses of St.
Quentin. They’ve been good landlords to me,
and I’ve been a good tenant to them. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Lord, Your Ladyship, Ladies and Gentlemen,
we didn’t look to see this happy day.
All of us standing here have got a lot to
thank God for. He has raised up his lordship
and given us the fine strong heir as we’re
thanking Him for to-day. I’ll not deny but
that we looked forward to seeing the young
lady that we’ve learned to love reign over
us, but it seems she’s satisfied with the woman’s
kingdom that is hers to-day. God bless her!
and give her and her husband that is to be
every happiness, and the same to you, My
Lord and Your Ladyship. And in the name
of your lordships’ tenants, I wish a long and
happy life, and all prosperity, to Sidney, Lord
Lisle.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was indeed a happy day, but there
was one to come that was even happier—the
day on which Sydney Lisle laid down her
maiden name and became, what she had always
felt herself, a Chichester.</p>

<p>Lord St. Quentin gave the bride away.
“A thing which I am bound to do considering
it was I who took her from you,” he said,
laughing.</p>

<p>He and Hugh were good friends by this
time, all the better perhaps for having begun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
as the famous Mrs. Malaprop would say,
with “a little aversion,” and Hugh did not
misunderstand the marquess when he said—“Sydney
used to annoy me by insisting upon
being three-parts Chichester when I wished
her to be all Lisle: now it is my turn to
insist that she does not quite forget the Lisle
side, when she is a Chichester by right.”</p>

<p>“But we are all <em>one</em> family now, aren’t we,
Quin?” Sydney said softly, and her cousin
did not contradict the statement.</p>

<p>It was on a perfect September day, with
that deeper blue in the clear sky and wonderful
freshness in the air which summer’s end brings
with it, that Sydney was married.</p>

<p>As on that first morning at the Castle long
ago, she rose before the rest of the household,
and went out into the Park, where diamond
dew lay thick and the hedges sparkled with
jewelled cobwebs.</p>

<p>She would not call Dolly to come with her:
she wanted for a little while upon this happy
morning to be the lonely Sydney again.</p>

<p>But there was little to recall that first walk,
as she stood on the marble steps of the Castle
and looked into the glory of September sunshine
glittering around her.</p>

<p>She went through the Park, making for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
gap in the hedge she knew so well, and drinking
in the beauty which was so atune with her
heart to-day—the dark-foliaged trees, the upland
fields, some bare, some covered still with
corn-sheaves, stacked in <em>hiles</em>, as the Blankshire
people called them—the glitter of dew
at her feet, where every tiny blade of grass
seemed jewelled in the sunshine.</p>

<p>She could not resist one peep through the
mullioned windows of the quaint, dark, comfortable,
Queen Anne house, furnished throughout
by loving hands to suit the girl’s taste.
The fittings from her luxurious rooms in
the Castle had gone with her to this new home
by St. Quentin’s wish, and the beautiful plate
on the sideboard spoke eloquently enough of
the feeling among the tenantry of the estate
for “our young lady.”</p>

<p>Mackintosh had filled the conservatory with
his choicest flowers, and Bessie and the pair
of ponies already inhabited the roomy stables.
This was to be her home and Hugh’s. Her
home and Hugh’s!—how good it sounded!</p>

<p>Her eyes shone as she turned into the road
leading into the village.</p>

<p>How different all was from that first walk,
when the new life had appeared so strange
and lonely, and home so terribly far away!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Had it ever seemed possible then that she
would come to love Lislehurst so well, could
come to be as happy there as she was to-day?</p>

<p>At the gap where they had first met Pauly
was waiting, with a basket and a broad smile
of satisfaction on his round chubby face.</p>

<p>“Going to get mushrooms,” he explained,
submitting to her kiss. “Muvver’s coming,
and daddy, and dear Dr. Hugh. Come too!”</p>

<p>“Not this morning, Pauly dear,” said Sydney,
“but another morning we will all go out together,
won’t we, and have a good time? Now
good-bye, and don’t forget to come and help
us eat the wedding cake.”</p>

<p>“Do I hear you pressing wedding cake
on Pauly?” observed Pauly’s father, appearing
at the moment, also armed with a mighty
basket. “Please don’t, for I assure you it
is quite unnecessary. He never needs much
pressing, do you, Pauly? Miss Lisle, won’t
you come into the Vicarage and have some
milk or something, in memory of that first
visit that you paid us?”</p>

<p>“When I missed breakfast altogether, and
had such a scolding from Lady Frederica for
paying calls upon my own account,” Sydney
said, laughing. “No, not this morning, thank
you, Mr. Seaton: I must hurry home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of a scolding now?”
the Vicar asked with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said. “I don’t think Katharine
ever learned the way to scold, and St. Quentin
has forgotten it.”</p>

<p>And then she put her hand on the Vicar’s
arm, as he held the gate open for her.</p>

<p>“Do you remember our talk on that first
morning that we met, and how you told me
there was work for everyone to do, if they
would look for it? I don’t suppose you know
how much that helped me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the Vicar with a smile,
“that is a thing it does one good to hear.
But it is not everyone who looks to such
good purpose as you did.”</p>

<p>And, as Sydney walked rapidly away, he
looked after her, thinking of the great results
which had followed on the girl’s simple
straightforward performance of that work
she found to do.</p>

<p>He thought of the enormous difference to be
seen in the villages all over the estate; of their
owner, honestly striving to do his best for
the people whose comfort was committed to
his charge; of the happy marriage brought
about by her means, and he did not wonder
at the hearty cheers with which the bride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was received, as she came down the crimson-covered
churchyard path upon her cousin’s
arm.</p>

<p>Sydney flushed with pleasure: it was very
pleasant to feel herself surrounded by so much
affection and goodwill.</p>

<p>“I am so very glad it is not ‘good-bye’
to this home,” she whispered to St. Quentin;
and he smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p>She had her own way about the wedding
festivities, and all the tenants, rich and poor
alike, were feasted in the Castle grounds.</p>

<p>It was a day long remembered through the
county, and any doubt the tenants may have
felt as to Sydney’s perfect pleasure in her
dispossession were quite swept away then by
the sight of her radiant face.</p>

<p>“Our young lady,” she would be always
to the Lislehurst people, but they plainly saw
that she was happy in the humbler path her
feet were to tread.</p>

<p>“She looked for all the world like a bit of
spring and sunshine,” Mrs. Sawyer used to
say, in talking of that happy wedding day,
“and Dr. Hugh, his face matched hers for
gladness, as it should. God bless ’em both!”</p>

<p>It was a bewilderingly happy day, from the
moment that Sydney put her hand into Hugh’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
strong one, where she could so safely trust her
future, to that in which Pauly, after some
loudly whispered directions from old Mr.
Hudder, marched forward, and laid in Sydney’s
hand the lovely little gold watch, with which
she had parted for the sake of her poorer
neighbours. “For you,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“A testimony of respectful affection from
his lordship’s tenantry in Lislehurst to their
young lady,” Mr. Hudder amended.</p>

<p>“And I gave free pennies for it,” Pauly
put in.</p>

<p>I think Sydney nearly cried as she kissed
the little boy and held out her hand to Mr.
Hudder.</p>

<p>“Thank you, and thank everybody, oh, so
much!” she said.</p>

<p>But perhaps the very best moment in the
whole long happy day was that in which
Sydney Chichester was able to throw her
arms about the neck of father and mother,
and call herself “their little girl” again.</p>

boys. He has no bad habits, and his manliness inculcates the idea
that it is not necessary for a boy to indulge in petty vices to be a hero.

to follow. Twenty volumes now ready:</p>
